"i updated to the new version on 5/7/19. Now whenever I try starting the app it brings up a green screen, sits there for a while, and then brings up a message saying it timed out. it gives me the option to wait or close the app. i would uninstall it but I don't want to lose my rewards. update: great job fixing the problem so quickly. Definitely earned more stars."
"Well it does not interface with my fitness device. It's rating or stress that cetera on phone calls is shall we say a highly creative. A good call with my daughter will be rated as stressful, and a bad call with a parent for I was being very careful with what I said and how I said it will be rated as good. I had to turn off automatic sleep tracking, because if you don't verify it the next day properly, it doesn't count. The same four steps. It is easier to enter them manually, then to leave the automatic tracker on."
"I am not a fan of this app. The app is not responsive, and doesn't allow easy editing. Some of the data is changed with me making changes (medication not being listed anymore). When I tried to list the medication again the app would not let me. The data that is asked for is very basic, to be a health tracker. I am really surprised that water intake is not asked for. The app freezes a lot and seems to be buggy."
"UPDATE- The app was updated and then it started to work again. So going good so far as of today 2/27/19. This app was working for the first 2 weeks. I have my fit bit synced and it was working,. It is supposed to automatically track my steps and it quit doing that, and I now have to manually enter them . It says my tracker is synced, but it will not work."
"App frequently signs me out, will not sync data quickly, is glitchy & all-around has a ton of bugs. I am supposed to be using this app daily for my insurance through my employer and it is extremely aggrivating that I have to waste so much time trying to get it to work. Uninstalling & re-installing never seems to help these bugs as it is a programming error. Also the fact that I always enter my data before bed makes me miss a lot of points-if I forget to do so before midnight, I lose them."
Attempting to use daily. The app crashes every time i try to log relationships and stress. Diet tracking doesn't make sense since it really doesn't require all meals in a day to be logged. Keep watching for improvements but it's discouraging to use the app and still have to sign in online to ensure a green day due to crashing features. Update: 12/11/18 app still crashes for same reasons and now my steps are wrong. My steps from Sat synced from my fitbit showing as Fri steps! Discouraging.
"App needs a lot of improvement. The information you input is so vague. For example, to track your diet, all it asks is whether your message was extra small, small, medium, large, or extra large, and if it was bad, poor, average, good or excellent. And you can't even rate each meal separately, even though you can select breakfast, lunch or dinner. I'm uninstalling the app."
"Very helpful, and insightful in letting you know where your health stands. Keeps you in check daily, to do the right stuff for your body, and mind, and to help you become a better you in both the physical, and mental state. l love this app! Especially love the meditation sounds, music and sights! üëç"
This is one of the worst apps I have ever seen. I manually track steps and even that fails every day when trying to enter. I have to submit steps twice. It also doesn't record days. Their support is terrible. I guess it is ok to tell the customer that they just don't know why something is not tracking correctly. I am sure Blue Cross is paying a lot of money for this app. A total waste of money
"After the latest updates it's a lot better. Still not able to enter in missed data but I think that's by design. Also I'm having an issue with medication tracking. I removed all the medicines in my health profile because they're not being taken but I still have to say and enter in that I've taken them to get that area green. It has not removed them. Much better app now that it Fitbit syncs, the auto stress and relationships is pretty off yet and sometimes will give you funny responses"
"Useless. it logs me out as soon as i leave the app and then gives me frequent notifications of being logged out (even when setting it to stay logged in). the emails are just spam because the links don't even take you to the articles. The steps don't work and when you turn the steps off, the app flips out and sends you even more notifications. Waste of time."
"This app is adding to my stress, not taking it away. I can't manually enter the number of steps and it won't connect to my Fitbit account. The food tracking isn't that great. Inputting my blood pressure every day is difficult if there isn't a machine handy. Every time I go to input Stress and Relationships status it asks to connect to my contacts which I already have turned off in settings. Every time I open the app it automatically starts to track steps when that's also turned off."
"This app sucks. It doesnt sync the tracking from google fit or Samsung Health. for any of the things, steps, sleep, stress, etc. This app only syncs up for the day you open it and edit the item to look it up. It does not get the history for the month, so if you are expecting it to use google, Samsung or fitbit good luck. The Ap constantly crashes and restarts."
"Too many of the supposedly automatic features, like activity tracking, sleep tracking and especially stress and relationship tracking don't work. Initially I didn't want to give the app permission to enable stress tracking, but when I gave it a try, I got a message saying it was unable to provide a stress evaluation. What gives?"
"It is amazing how you all analyze my phone calls to determine my mood swings. They are sually, on point. I love how you track my steps. The exercise and eating tips are wonderful. I also can keep up with my reward points and apply to deductibles and co pays. The counselors are very helpful and kind. Thank you."
"Very glitchy. Even though this has a pin login option, it still forces me to log in with my username and password every time. Very annoying. Very unintuitive UI, difficult to find what you're looking for, every screen is clunky and overcrowded. Worthless app and worthless program."
"Terrible app. won't connect to my Fitbit, gives a worthless error, and often won't let me enter my steps manually. zero other benefit to the app. every time I start it there's a message that says: \"" Something went wrong.\"" Awesome job, developers, thanks for the meaningless error!"
"Still logs me out constantly, and very power hungry if I allow all permissions it asks for. Very intrusive in my option with all the permissions. I have gotten to the point that I deny all of them, and just input my steps manually every day. The automatic steps does not pull from google fit, as it only tracks from the phone which is useless as I don't carry my phone most of the day, and track my steps from my watch instead. Basically only do this for the rewards, but this app in not friendly."
"My FitBit steps have stopped syncing to the monthly steps challenge as of February 4th. It worked fine for all of January, then it just stopped. The steps and other FitBit metrics sync to the main tracking section, just not the challenge, which how I earn wellness incentive $. I am aware I can track manually for the challenge, but that shouldn't be necessary. Customer support is totally unresponsive."
I like that it tracks sleep & that I can edit it. Phone stress is good. Gives me insite. Not sure what happened to steps. Used to count small numbers and when I was only able to do 200 to 300 a day getting to 500 was a BIG deal. Now it only starts @ 1000. It's as important for mobility impaired to track improvement as the mile makers.
"app sized incorrectly, cuts off the answer area of all quiz questions and the zero of the pin pad. Wants too many permissions and doesn't track much of what I'm interested in. insists on asking for A1C despite my not being diabetic. doesn't give points or rewards for being as nosy as this is. offers woo-tastic articles instead of science based. not worth the space on my phone deleting app."
Update- Awesome response time from the developer! The app was fixed and available for update in just over 12 hours. It is now working properly again. Version 3.7.1 Original review- I just updated to the most recent version of this app and the app will not longer open. It freezes on the logo splash screen.
The new and improved look feels old and outdated. The previous version felt sleek and more ready for the future. It would be nice if I could choose a skin layout for the app. The app does work well when it does work.
"App is great IF, and that's ONLY IF I can use it for more than 3 seconds each time before it crashes. It does not stay on long enough to even reap the benefits of the great features the app has to offer. Really stinks."
"I hate this app. As soon as I get get credit for completing the required tracking for my company, I will delete it. It frequently loses track of my settings, and I have to log in again and renew them. It asks me to track information which I cannot measure. If I forget to track my data by the end of the day, I cannot go back the next day and enter it. In fact, I cannot see how I can view any historical data. This app is useless!"
"This app is not user friendly. It is also very frustrating that email articles don't open in the app, only opens app and you have to search for the articles. The app doesn't send notifications about your progress or reminders to complete tasks other than reporting steps. I don't allow apps to follow me which is required for tracking steps, neither do I wear my phone so step counts are not accurate."
this app is ridiculus. does not work. too many bugs! limited entry for diet. calorie counting non existant. updating info difficult and time consuming. stress monitoring not accurate. relationship choices not applicable. auto sleep tracking is total wrong. it is prompted by plugging in charger. really? so I sleep everytime I charge my phone? disappointed that Dr Oz is associated with this trashy app
"This is, without exageration, the worst app I have ever used. It draws more power than anything else on my phone while failing to function at all. My Blue Cross health insurance forces us to use it to track steps, which it is terrible for."
"Not a bad way to earn credits with health insurance. However this particular version I am using at the start of 2019 won't track my steps, nor can I manually enter them. That was one of the items always in green for me by the end of the day last year :("
"Won't stop tracking my steps every time I start the app, even though I have them turned off in the options. It's incredibly annoying. I would rather manually enter as I have a misfit which tracks much better."
"Sync issues, signs out on it's own constantly, could use more options for different types of smart watches that are not Google fit or fitbit, plenty of stuff that needs fixing in this app Reply: I rated based on my experience. If you guys want to fix your app, read what the issue is and fix it. Not my job to call support, you don't pay me."
"This app does not track your steps like it says it does and if you try to enter the correct amount, it will take about 10,000 steps from. Customer service is also ZERO, contacted them and they were no help at all even with detailed evidence of my steps, they still refused to correct the numbers and I did not get the money that was due me. I think they intentionally have the app not work properly so they can deny people the money. Wish I can give zero star."
"Most of the app is excellent, the stress level report that monitors your phone calls has me questioning if the app is a little bogus though. I am laughing yet the report says I am intense, irritated and frustrated. This happens on most of my calls. I can be cursing someone out and it says I am balanced and calm, these reports are starting to seem random and not based in fact."
So slooooow. So slow to launch and then to open the Track page. I can't imagine trying to use this to log anything on a regular basis. Step tracking is wonky- the other day it said I had 9000 steps done already when I had only gotten up a half hour earlier.
"Freezes, especially when entering stress data (go figure?); doesn't sync with multiple fitness trackers (Garmin), so manual entry for health plan rewards, changed in fall to be even more difficult; complicates what should be automated."
"This app is an extremely invasive app...to the extent of being creepy. Will access my microphone THOUSANDS of times a day. Reached out last year to the developers about the access and they said they'd never heard of it. Denying access causes it to malfunction. And then all of my personal information is on it too? Seems like an incredibly underhanded way to intrude on your life. Unfortunately I am \""incentivized\"" by my insurance company to use it. Will be deleting as soon as I reach my goals."
"Updates to the daily report are slow to save. Not a fan of latest screen updates, too much white screens, where's dark mode? Sync works well with Fitbit. Newest update as increased the speed for the daily reports. Thank you."
"Won't let me edit my steps when I choose edit. Says my data is tracked automatically. No it's not. No option to add Samsung gear fit tracking. In all, the new update seems like a step backward."
They want access to record my phone calls and to be able to record at all times! No!!!!! They step WAY over the line for permissions. Their step counter (which I couldn't disable) has a notification always on which is pretty annoying.
"7500 steps a day, 21 days out of the month for reimbursement = great concept but before I got my smartwatch I would obviously need to have my phone on me. Well it didn't automatically track any of my steps for the last week! Now I have my Galaxy Smartwatch Active 2 and am using Samsung Health to connect to Sharecare and low and behold, they aren't matching up. Sharecare says its synced therefor should be taking what my Galaxy devices are detecting but it's not! Ridiculous! Manually enter? Wow!"
"The steps tracker is not reliable, and since the update it won't let me manually enter my steps. I taught all day (around 4500 steps for me) and then did 2 miles at the gym (another 400+ steps), only to find out later that it wasn't tracking me all day. How are we supposed to complete challenges when it won't track properly and won't let me add the steps it missed? Frustrating!"
"If this apps function was to open it and show \""a \""heart and Sharecare\"" and do nothing else, I would give it 5 Stars. But I downloaded it to use it not look at it. I would rate it higher if I could open it. I'd rate it higher if I could even see a button to try and open it. I'm not being picky but being able to open an app is kind of a big part in the overall customer satisfaction process. Other than not being able to open it, see it, try it, use it or figure out the point of it, it's a great."
The is no tatorial for app so you miss a bunch of things. Does not track steps att all. Doesn't even link steps from google fit and will not all me to edit step count as it resets my entry every time. Sleep tracking so far off. my company uses this app to give health incentives but its completely worthless.
"First, the permissions this app is requesting are more or less ludicrous. No, you cannot record my phone calls to monitor my \""voice stress\"". Second, and more important, I downloaded this app to see what they were recommending for proper nutrition practices. Nutrition is THE foundation to better health, and regrettably this app is still applying tried and failed nutritional advice. Such a shame when perceived authority figures provide counterproductive info to those who only want to do better."
"I haaaate this app. When the app works, it slows the performance of my phone but usually it just crashes and forces me to force close it. I can't enter my stuff reliably so I just quit using the program."
I tried to sign up but it keeps saying my credentials are already being used and to sign in. But I've never used this app so I don't have credentials. I thought maybe it was an error I even tried signing in with the info I put in even though it said error but still nothing. I even tried using a different email. Please fix this!
"I didn't realize how much I wasn't taking care of my health until I downloaded this app. It really opened my eyes to a healthier lifestyle! Convenient and it works. Only thing I would change is how the calls are rated. (Ex. Uneasy, impatient, etc.)"
"This hasn't been a bad ap but I wish it would allow you to manually update you previous days data. Or, it could sync with more than a fit or phone ap tracker so it would automatically sync your day end data."
Will not sync with my fitbit steps no matter what I try. I've even gone back andew days later to see if it just needed time to catch up and no steps are ever recorded from Fitbit. I have to manually enter them each day which I lose track of.
"Shuts down every single time I open it. I'll have about 10-15 seconds in it if I'm lucky before it shuts down. If I didn't have to use it for work, I would uninstall it from my phone. Very frustrating app."
Very aggravating....will not track items when you need it most. Mine will not track my steps when I'm at the end of an award based on steps. At other times you can't input your data for the day. This app is tied to my insurance for wellness program points and is about to make me miss out on points.
"Medications can only be put in as taken daily. So you realize there are meds taken at other intervals. It seems to be a good intentioned app, however, the navigation could be improved in areas."
Unable to input previous day information if you forget to the day of which means a lost day of exercise reported to insurance. The internal tracker doesn't count all steps even when connected to Google fit and was constantly 2000 or more steps short of my Google fit numbers. Asks about blood glucose contently even when marking that you are not diabetic. Asks me to estimate my cholesterol daily too and that only gets checked once a year by my doctor. This app hasn't reduced any of my stress.
"Interferes with my ability to receive calls by \""hogging\"" the microphone. I spent days troubleshooting my Samsung phone along with my carrier, Republic Wireless and their Help Team. Wouldn't recommend this app to anyone."
"This app is a joke. Always seems to get really glitchy around the 21st day of the month, which just so happens to be the day you can first claim the fitness incentive. I wouldn't use it if weren't the only fitness incentive that my employer provides. I'd rather have the gym membership discount I used to have."
"The app used to sync with my Fitbit app so I did no have to manually enter my info daily. The app is no longer syncing. I have reinstalled and reconnected apps, still does not work."
"I'm getting an error when I'm trying to connect my Fitbit, but when I try to \""submit a request\"" from the app, I get an error with that as well. also, it won't let me track my meds, I enter that I took them, but it won't save the entry."
"One of the most stressful apps I've ever used. Asks if you're diabetic, and then tells you to measure glucose after you say no. Tracks steps, but logs out halfway through the day and only counts half."
Worthless. Doesn't retain information and won't sink with fitbit. Which I could I overlook if you could edit information but it doesn't. Especially disappointing since our employer is using this service for insurance credits.
I have been using this app daily for over a month . My companys new insurance plan will give us 20 dollars a month. If you walk over 7500 steps a day 21 out of the month. All well and good but I don't really know if I'm on it. The person in our company to go to is not sure. I've spent more time trying to navigate this site than all my other apps combined. Its hard to check progress. I could go on and on. I think it tries to do too much.
"I have never successfully used this app on my phone. It crashes every ten seconds, every time I use it. Garbage considering it's our only option for BCBS tracking."
"The worst ap I have EVER encountered! It makes up data, loses real data, and doesn't sync with Fitbit properly! Sharecare customer service is rude and snotty, just like you would expect an insurance company to act when you have a problem you need help with! Total junk and unreliable!"
"Terrible experience so far had the program for 2 months now... no challenges still available:)! Have my insurance information and everything on there. Emailed support just to get asked if my insurance has changed? Had the same insurance for the past 4 years, yet it works for all my coworkers? Miss the gym reimbursement never had to jump through hoops like this program is lol."
"The app is slow, clunky, unprofessional! Typical of the our health system in this country. You have to put in your information twice before it accepts it and sometimes it still won't accept. I hate this app and yet it's tied to me getting more HRA points."
"For your real age function it asks you questions about home safety, and if your vehicle has airbags. There is quite a few unnecessary questions that are off topic to your health. Also requests for all permission access to your device. Unnecessary and invasive."
Doesn't track steps correctly. My watch correctly sends the information to Samsung Health. When Sharecare syncs with Samsung Health it posts some random number so you don't get credit in the challenges.
The app has slowed down tremendously since the update. There is lag at every single input causing updating tracking each day to be really frustrating. Did you make the app too big?? Please fix. I like doing the green days.
"Will fry your battery and listens to your calls; I'm not exaggerating. The first permission screen gives a message from the app telling you it will listen to your calls to detect your stress levels. Seriously? I have a Moto G5 and since installation, my battery has drained 40 percent in under 2 hours. I checked settings and it's this app. Uninstalled."
It has numerous issues and is slow. It has a lot of improvement needed. It has issues with syncing and have had to contact support numerous times.
Latest update stopped letting me update some parts of my tracker. The app crashes anytime I try to track relationship or stress. So disappointed because now I'm not having as many green days. üòï Not fair!!!
Super slow and unresponsive app. All other apps work like they should on my phone besides this one. It takes about 5 times longer than it should to do anything on this app.
"It just periodically signs you out and stops tracking, which us a big problem when you need items tracked for an achievement. A frustrating app"
"Hard to use and figure out, frequently crashes. No integration to other fitness trackers. In other words, horrible."
"Mostly good. Had trouble navigating and claiming rewards. Also, my Samsung health monitor syncs doesn't always capture my steps."
"When I first downloaded the app, it worked fine... then it stopped tracking my steps and will not hold the steps that I enter manually... noe, the app will not even open! Ugh!"
not consistant..poor customer service. sleep and step tracking skips days at a time. only keeping it for the articles may delete it soon since have a more dependable app tracking both
"I already use a garmin for my daily steps & workouts, use Bodyspace to keep track of my actual workouts, and log my daily meals into myfitnesspal. I'm mildly annoyed that this wants me to relog that info in again. And I really dont appreciate the fact it wants me to turn off my power saving mode on my phone. Not happy with this app currently."
Its terrible! It does NOT sync correctly with my Fitbit even though it says its tracking. I've had to email several times and call Sharecare.
this app would not let me enter an ID or password without coming up error. I made several attempts and had to finally uninstall it because I could not open it. Very disappointed
Signs me out every day. No longer tracks steps even though enabled. Totally worthless. Now they want me to contact support who won't do any but tell you wrong information and and you uninstall/reinstall 500 times. Total joke still. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME
"If you live in country with bad wi-fi or are not computer literet your screwed. Your telephone reps & health guides are great & helpful. But on the heart part of app they dont even know how to guide me on some of the questions if i dont I Phone, arm tracker.& no internet. The suites in corperate seemed to roll this out before they looked at all the clients other than just the ones in major cities. Your staff & reps are great. Im going to miss out on points because of IT. & corperate this year ."
"Constantly crashing. Every time you click on something, the app crashes and you have to start over again."
input interface doesn't work all the time. Can't use some of the tracking without using their apps.
"I enjoyed using this app until recently when it kept booting me out before I could really do anything! I hope this is fixed soon. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but that didn't work."
I enjoy this health tool because it keeps me on my toes.üò¨ I end up walking twice as much as normal just to meet my daily health goals. Im able to monitor my HBP and Diabetes with this bluetooth enabled tool. If had really made me accountable for my daily health habits. üíõ
Opened this app for the first time in months and it is constantly crashing within 10 sec! Was going to learn app since it part of health plan so this is a real discouragement.
"This app helps me to be healthier, to think about my health more and to make better choices with what I eat. There are videos and articles with great information. I really like it."
"Too clunky. Way too much \""stuff\"" to update to get a green day. I will go back to my Fitbit app and remove this one. My employer pays me $20 to get steps in daily and it isn't worth the effort with this app."
Love the feedback on my phone calls. I didn't think I was stressed but when I read the narrative I realize it is accurate!
App crashes everytime you edit steps and wont let you go back to edit a day. Closes every time. Garbage app.
"Worked fine for a few days, now my Fitbit wont sync steps at all. What's the point when that is what our incentive thru work is? It also stinks that you cannot edit the previous day's steps."
"tries to take over your phone only want to use the step counter and register my green days, use a it because it has motivated me with the step/green day promotion.and ohhh yea also cause your phone to say promotion at the top where your carrier name should be and at that time your screen is locked till you close out of everything and reboot phone so annoying..have only noticed this since joining the green day/ 5000a day steps...now its trying to force me to use one of the fit bit permissions uggg"
"Worked great until May 6. Uninstalled app because it would not allow input for weight. Reinstalled, no change. Disappointing . . ."
The step tracking feature is okay but I can't log my actual exercise that happens at the gym. The steps I take on the treadmill don't count because my phone is at rest. Why is the app a day off?
Only works with Fitbit and won't sinc with other apps such as Strava or Garmin Connect. But they allow you manually input your data. Seriously?
I don't appreciate having to open my app a couple times a week for my steps to sync. I also don't enjoy having to login every third or fourth time.
Glad with all the information just kinda annoying that it keeps up with my calls and constantly having to update me and notifying me on my progress or my evaluation on my phone calls.
"only 4 because it NEEDS a \""loves\"" or \""favorites\"" button so we van save all the great items we will want and we can have them in a list for when were ready to buy"
What is the point of linking your Fitbit if the steps you take aren't automatically logged on this app? I can't even input them for a previous day. Very disappointed!
I hate this app. It's awfully invasive and nosey. It wants to use my contacts? Why? I have to use this app for my insurance through my job. I wish it a rapid death.
"the call analysis seems off, I laugh it says I am stressed , steps, I don't always carry phone can I sync with Fitbit. do love the yoga, meditation , info is very good"
"Waste of my time. Answered all of the daily questions, was in the green every day, was well above the required steps each day, yet it still claims i didn't earn the fitness incentive for the month"
"Major Battery Issues, and why does \""detect steps\"" have to be enabled if I have Google Fit linked? Isn't that two different apps counting steps?"
"This app is truly ridiculous!!! Obviously there was no beta testing with actual doctors, or doctors who know what the f*** is going on. Being a T1D checking my blood sugar is important, and getting my A1C is done 4 times a year, but this app wants my A1C done daily ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. On the medicine side it's wanting me to overdose on my insulin ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è and didn't ask how I dose my self (needles, pens, pump, or inhalables) and to take my glucagon shots daily not in the case of a sugar low."
Tends to freeze up making tracking a chore. My company has incentives linked to use of ShareCare but I miss them because it has never worked properly.
The app updated and now won't open up. My green days are disappearing even after entering the data.
Will re-install when you integrate with Samsung Health and/or Watches. Total waste of time otherwise.
"Love having this to give me knowledge about stress, weight loss, anxiety and such. also evaluating my calls for stress helps me too."
Horrible app. Doesnt track well at all and always loses my info conveniently. So how do you get your rewards? You probably don't. Big F-
"Sucks big time, notifications are sent, however when you click on something that might interest you, its no where to be found"
App will force the access of your phone. No option to use it without full access. I will not use it!
"Few of the health \""trackers\"" stopped working. Also as of 9/30/18, a new update is available and I cannot update nor complete my daily activity/tracker"
"This is not accurate in recording steps, sleep, etc. I have to continue to update manually."
not recording sleep. this has not happened before just started March 1. I have already went to the app and updated it still nothing. If I need customer service please provide the phone number.
"Slow, very buggy, locks up, and trying to open links is futile most of the time."
"Wow, seriously?? All these crash reports and this is still an issue? I'm lucky if I get 15 seconds before it crashes."
"App freezes up when trying to track. There are times that \""back\"" takes you out of app."
Great app for living healthy lifestyle. Encouraging and informative articles and videos. Also wonderful recipes
"I Like Some Things About the App: I can edit my hours of sleep, but not my steps. So they aren't accurate. It counts my steps only when I'm carrying my phone."
"This apps uses alot of battery power on your cellphone. Also, the steps are not counted correctly."
Crashes constantly. I hate that I have to even use this app to get a discount on my health insurance for work.
i was able to create an account.... that's it. says no connection on two different wifi networks and cellular
"Once again, I can't log in to my account, or get sound from the videos in the app. Ehat is going on. Why did you change the format. I don't like the new one."
There seems to be some hiccups in the app. It doesn't recognize stress appropriately.
Terrible App. Been crashing for days and no editing capabilities. Deleting this app.
This apps latest update continues to have issue with allowing 'steps' entry. Will not save.
Meh. I will keep checking to see if you have added Samsung to your supported trackers. I have too much time invested in Samsung to start all over.
This quites tracking when you get so many steps just not worth the space it takes on the phone.
App won't open. Looks like there was an update. Even forced app to stop.
make it able to sync to Garmin devices. this app is a.way that insurance does not have to pay you. how many people are going to log each day!
"Unable to get on app. I did download it, but am not having any luck trying to access it."
App is constantly crashing and kicking you out. Needs fixed.
my app will not open the last 2 days? please fix this problem. I updated it but it still keeps closing on me?
Awesome app to track your daily activities and get motivation to live a healthy life.
Worked fine the first month or so. Now it shuts down after 20 seconds or less everyone I open it.
super hard to navigate. not showing the same as online account.
App takes too long to load and drains your battery. I uninstalled.
Keeps crashing love the app but only stays open for like a minute at a time...grrr
The app works great. This app can really help folks realize how all your life factors can affect your overall health.
App is very limited and doesn't sink with Garmin products. Also seems to kill battery life.
The app constantly keeps crashing when you are trying to track your data
worst app I've ever seen in my life I can't even finish the real age test because it takes me two different pages that have nothing to do with that
Great app but... I really think you should allow us to connect to Samsung Health.
Solid app with useful information and tools for managing your health.
Since I started using this it has kept me more health conscious start a exerciseplan and staying with it as well as tracking all vitals Thank you Dr.OZ
"Thank you for fixing this app..Hasn't closed down in a week now, working perfectly"
not working. after the ada and gina terms update i get server error. now i cant use it at all.
I am unable to link my garmin device for activity tracking. needs to support more than Fitbit.
"lots if info. sometimes overwhelming, but very informative."
It no longer opens even with an uninstallation and update.
please add ability to sync with Samsung health or samsung watches.
Signs out constantly and doesn't track fitbit steps.
Last update did something to the Medications section of the checkin. It won't switch from yellow to green when you in what you took that day. #bug
continually crashes. nearly impossible to track
"Super invasive, if you need a nanny, feel free to install."
Earlier problem was corrected...lost data was restored within 12 hours of requesting correction
Very easy way to track health and fitness
App frequently crashes and is barely usable.
Very glitchy. App closes all the time.
Stops tracking and working altogether often.
I love how this app keeps track of things. And I love the helpful tips.
Took away earned days from my challenge when it updated.
My site will closes everytime I enter information. This tracking information is important to me. Please fix this.
My fitbit sync doesn't seem to work properly
Why doesn't this app stay logged in? Every now and then it logs out. Really gets on my nerves.
"This program is awful! If you decide to redeem your points, your paycheck will be significantly less. Beware!"
Thank you for designing an App that helps keep me centered!
Fit Bit won't count steps and has issues logging on
app won't open for manual updates since update
"Excessive battery drain. Daily Blood-Glucose reading are not measured via A1C. I would rate this App as a beta version 0.5, written by someone who doesn't know much about health."
Excellent app. Enjoy the challenges.
terrible I installed and unistalled it several time doesn't work
My health and Mobility seems overall better my health activity and Mobility overall is better
"since the update today, the app won't open"
kills battery and does not accurately measure steps. deleting
"Repeatedly having difficulties clicking on, and submitting info on questions asked."
"They send you spammy emails with bad \""advice\"" blogs and articles by the charlatan \""Dr.\"" Oz. If you want health or medical advice, this is definitely not a trustworthy source."
it keeps cutting g off and wont let me log anything.
You cant create an account - so you cant use the app without giving them personal information
i enjoy the healthy information and ability to see how I'm doing on steps for healthy living
never works to log in always says I dont have internet connection
crashes/freezes often.
App keeps stopping and exiting.
"Good app, but I prefer others to track my health more accurately"
Great but crashes alot.
It's ok. Would be better if I could link my Samsung watch.
I love it especially when i make a phone call it track and tells me how i was if i was anxious and soforth..i aslo love that it track my sleep also my steps..i love u sharecare
"Stupid app. No results for my thyroid med, not even my store."

This app is wonderful if you take the time to work on it
Keeping me updated and on track!
like the information.Still learning
Really helpful information.
"EXTREMELY INTRUSIVE. Sharecare \""RealAge\"" use being forced onto me by my health insurance provider, Mountain State Blue Cross Blue Shield. Non-compliance in their demand to allow FULL access to your PRIVATE medical records will result in raised insurance premiums. Linking insurance gives Sharecare rights to \""without limitation\"" share your personal information with undisclosed \""providers\"" and \""authorized organizations\"", and states you lose HIPAA rights, and possibly GINA rights."
just updated today and it wont open...
Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't
Unable to down load
It ok but doesn't always seem right. Dont let u know when you earn a reward
Easy to keep track of my progress.
"App won't open, again."
Love get e-gift card for just doing what I normally do every single day
It won't let me create an account. The website is busted too
So buggy! Crashes NON STOP
this app doesn't load at all
I am pretty curious and look forward to using this app
helps me to be mindful of my health and well being
"love, keeps me on track with the things I know I need to do fir myself."
This app does not work 90% of the time.
Y'all this app is the best y'all need to install it asap!
Curious to see if it is helpful

I very much love this app
I keep getting kicked out of the application.
Great for work

Forced tracking by health insurance company total BS
"Just got started, hopefully I will participate."
Not really useful
Sucks...can't get signed in
so far I like it.
Easy to use
"As a benefits manager, we will evaluate other options next cycle."
I like this app overall
I like it very much.
Please ove Love it love app
It is very beneficial for me.
Liking everything that it offers.
Their medication prices are manipulated to favor cvs and those are not even close to what you can truly save. This coming from a pharmacist
It never works
Love how it motivates me

"Went back to using it, and it worked o.k. Now it locks up on the splash screen. Tried clearing cache and force stop. Tried rebooting the device, no help. Pixel 1, Android 10."
Very good

This app is only for reporting medical information to your employer. They are collecting everyone's data and storing it. The insurance companies will find a way to use this data to raise our rates.
Keeps crashing.
Great Application!!üëçüèæ
great ppl
"I am a fairly calm and intelligent person, but this app works to make me think that I am a very anxious and inept person by analyzing my phone conversations and asking health questions no one can answer correctly. No positive encouragement found here! I have long suspected that the stress call evaluator just makes stuff up about users, and today I have proof. I was listening (not talking) to a computer generated voicemail. The evaluation: I seem nervous and concerned about what others think."
"Your voice analysis function SUCKS. How can your app tell me I am extremely anxious and stressed out during a phone call when I didn't say a word? That is what happens EVERY time my school district's automated message system calls with an announcement. These 30 - 45 second calls where I am only listening consistently register as INTENSE (Red) on the Stress and Relationship tracks. FIX THIS. Even conversations where I am totally calm are tracked as anything but Calm. INTENSE: your app, not me ü§¨."
Love the app!
Good information
"Sharecare dosen't work as it used to. I wear my phone religiously, but it only records steps about half of the days and so its week to week comparisons are worthless. It originally recorded low, then it recorded correctly(I think) and now it records intermittantly and often low again. I walk a half mile around a measured trail in the park, as well as walking around the rest of the day and it records 400 steps for the day? if I take a recorded call and say nothing,it gives me a rating."
EXCELLENT
good
great app
love it
it was ok
new
"This has it all! Highly personalized content, easy to use tracking, symptom checkers and more. Good content, with easy tips on how to be my healthiest self."
Too invasive
Like it
Ok
Unknown
It keeps losing my password and refuses to let me reset it
Keeps crashing since the new update.
It's just a poor app.
I like it very much
I like it
This app is so inaccurate about phone calls. It will say I'm stressed when I'm talking perfectly fine or when i don't even answer a call it will say that.
It freezes my phone every time I attempt to open this app. Its garbage
"Used for a week. Data entry required daily. Possible spying app. It requires access to microphone and other sensitive parts of your phone but I found no reason for it. Ir also conflicts with other apps causing them to fail. One example is ACR which every time I tried to do a recording, ShareCare app would hijack the microphone and terminate the recording. Disabling the permissions makes ShareCare fail so uninstalling this app. There is no reason it ahould have access to most of the things it requires permissions for. it seems to be a spyware app."
"The \""Auto Tracker\"" does not work. I played 18 holes of mini-golf Saturday night & it said that I only walked 94 steps for the WHOLE DAY! It says I haven't slept in 3 days. I get 6-8 hours of sleep a night. It insists on me meeting a normal person's goals but I am disabled & it doesn't allow for any disabilities. Overall: it NEEDS WORK!"
"It's causing me stress just thinking about having to input constantly. I also am uncomfortable about how it rates my phone calls and \""listens in\"". Too much private info to put out onto the internet. Just to name a few. Plus, sometimes the app just doesn't work."
I don't remember my password. Tried to reset it and kept saying an error has occured
Takes tons of battery on my old phone. If I forget to input I'm just screwed since there is no way to go back a to pervious days.
Wow it sensed my stress/relaxation during phone calls to a T! Just dl yesterday and already love it!
I love it!!! Very useful. Is like having someone couching you and guiding you in every aspect of your every day routine. Plus having a psychologist a your service.
In kamolol Anij kinke onake im Kojbarok eo an non na. ar jab jomlok Jen na Jen ien non ien
Trackers need some updates to be more accurate. Mic is active even when im not on a phone call at times
I really like this app it's really helping me deal with my stress and my business my life thank you
It told me I was stressed with every phone call
The worst app ever...freezed up the whole time trying to take real age test that is required for my health insurance. Please fix!!!
Glitchy. And customer service is lacking.
"Im brand new to this app. But so far, so good"
New to app hangs up sometimes
It won't let me sign up
Phone call analysis very interesting.
I don't think I can
Very useful and insightful!
Very helpful.
Good
Awesomm
This app is a pain. Can't link my Fitbit to it like most other apps and it doesn't accurately track steps or sleep even if you keep the phone on you all day. And the call monitoring feature comes up with results that are wayyy off base - I just used my phone to check a gift card balance on an AUTOMATED TOUCHTONE service and this app told me that I sounded impatient and the call was intense (I hadn't said a single word during that call!). The only reason I keep this is because my job requires you to use it to receive bonus $$ towards my benefits for the year...
The only issue I have is some of my information and tracking isn't current. That could be cause I'm trying not to be tied to my phone.
N√£o est√° contando meus passos di√°rios Step tracker doesn't work.
"The app does not allow some medications to be altered once they are added and dies not offer some medications as options. The administrators send automated replies that do not address the issues that have been reported. My insurance company requested that I join this app, but it is not worth the trouble and frustration of dealing with the apps shortcomings."
Isn't accurate at steps or sleep. As far as phone calls it's laughable. I am going to uninstall.
"After several correspondences, unable to resolve med tracker. Step tracker does not work, and call analysis on stress levels is way off. Not pleased with current level of service, but has potential."
"Pop up asking to rate app wouldn't let me press \""not now\"", so now I'm rating it 1 star."
Does not track sleep lots of times
So far it's been helpful.
Cool app
I love it
"I enjoy viewing the videos and reading the different topics. I like seeing my activity amount, sleep, and phone call evaluations. Even if I don't understand the reasons of the calls."
"This app is a nice idea, but needs a LOT of improvement! When listing meds, there needs to be a way to input exactly what the medication , the actual dose and exactly how often it is taken (i.e.: PRN). By-the-way, Vitamin D and Vitamin A are NOT the same!! Naps should be either accurately detected or the ability to add nap times for those of us tracking how much sleep we get in a day should be available. The ability to record actual times something was done should be available. For example, if meds were taken at 8a, but recorded at 10a, let the record show: 10a - Med. taken @ 8a. I DO NOT APPRECIATE MY PHONE CALLS BEING LISTENED IN ON!!! The app told me who I spoke to, how long the conversation was, a picture of my contact's information (name, pic ID & phone number), and what it thought about me regarding the call! It was inaccurate about how I felt! This app needs to be less invasive!! Many of the questions asked are also unnecessary, also! I feel like I'm carrying Big Brother around in a much more pronounced way than I already know exists!! üò†"
"This app is engaging, helps me to be more aware of the the things I need to become healthier. I feel more self aware."
It's very creepy. The listening to phone calls and evaluating stress is just plain creepy. So is monitoring sleep.
Nice concept but the phone calls are way off and often times make no sense. Please inprove the app. Sleep times are also very mixed up unless you imput them yourself.
I've had it for a couple of days and it makes me think about what I'm doing or eating.
Helps keep me focused on my health. Really like it..
Great for living a healthier better life .
Food gives plenty of room to leave.
Love all the information
I need to see episodes .
I like having this app helps me keep track.
"Will not track my steps. And to the chick who recently posted \"" I love how it helps with relationships\"" you are either fooling yourself or not very bright. This cannot help with relationships. Also by it listening to our phone conversations it is supposed to be able to track your mood? Again another fake out. Should have known when I found out that the quack Doctor Oz is behind this."
This is cumbersome. The phone call rating is awful. I have wonderful conversation with hubby and it tells me I am nervous and trying to impress talk to my hairdresser about an appointment and it tells me it was an emotionally meaningful conversation. Tells me I walked 369 steps on a very active day. Maybe I don't take my phone with me everywhere? I don't find it helpful.
"Off the bat, I can't set the language to English because I happen to be in Brazil. Oddly, only some content is in Portuguese. Immediate usability is pretty crappy."
Pretty good and accurate. Loved the stress calculator on voice calls
"I love how this app helps with relationships, sleep and eating info. Awesome I love it"
Feels like it is a little too intrusive
Day 2 and i love it
Great app
"This is the worst ever! It doesn‚Äôt even deserve a ‚Äúone‚Äù. Whenever I send an email concerning problems I am having, I receive the same information given on the website ~ no real solution! I sent an email back stating I had already done that and still doesn‚Äôt work. You are encouraged to get ‚ÄúGreen Day‚Äôs‚Äù but you are not allowed to log-in properly! I am totally disappointed that there is not a number to call to get a solid answer!"
I've heard a lot of good things and wanted to give it a shot. I like the idea of it but it really freaked me out. After I closed the app my phone alerted me that the app was using my microphone for the past 5 minutes. That wasn't on the permissions and a little weird to say the least. I've deleted this and will stick with better known apps.
"The measurements are unreliable since I don't always have my phone with me. It measures my exercise in the red, even after a 1.5-hour session at the gym, shoveling over 4.5\"" of wet snow & grocery shopping, not to mention house cleaning and decorating for St Patrick's day - in the same day. It doesn't measure sleep, either. As a result, I have only 2 green days this month when I should have at least 23. I sincerely hope medical providers don't rely on the info too heavily. Also, and this is very aggravating to me, this app lists my name as Daniel. There is no way to change it without contacting \""them\"" directly, and I REFUSE to sit on the phone for over 15 minutes listening to \""did you know...\"" messages, etc to make a verbal change to information that should be personally editable in \""My Account\"". The Walgreen's app is much more efficient, and that is not perfect, either."
This is the worst health app ever. Will not sync with wearable. Does not send you reminders to update your trackers. Will monitor your phone calls for stress and then adjust your tracker for the day. What a pain in the butt way to earn health credits!
Could not even sign up just says something went wrong. What a trash app. Thanks for the waste of time Goz.
"I set everything up after installing it, but now that I try to re-open it, it crashes. I've restarted my phone, in case that was affecting it somehow, but it still crashes after I open it."
I don't like this app but is appears I have to have it in order to get my HRS dollars. It is a dumb app that does nothing
"I don't check my blood pressure daily. I do check my blood sugar, but my daily measurement is not the same as an A1c number. It's as if someone with no medical knowledge wrote this app."
"I reinstalled it still you see Dr. Oz face and nothing else happens. Uninstall permanently! Also Sharecare stopped completely. This is a frustration app, I thought you help people not cause spike high-blood pressure!!!"
"I don't like that I cannot use my Fitbit to send my sleep and fitness stats. The app says it tracks automatically, but it does not. Also, I cannot update my medication properly. I don't care for this app at all. It's not user friendly."
I recently had a problem where it was continuously crashing so I uninstalled it and reinstalled it and now it works just fine
Follow up review -- I guess it front like my review -- the app will not open!
"Easy to use, Great info"
Very helpful and quite accurate
"Downloaded the app. I already have a shareware account for my email but don't recall the password. Asked the app 4 times to email me my password or a reset option. No email shows up. So, decided to create a new account. Won't let me, says an account exists. No app option for support. Hopefully someone who can help actually reads the reviews or I will just delete the app."
"It's a good start, but I can tell it's in the early phases. I think the call tracker is super call and fairly accurate. Could use other methods to detect stress levels for a more diverse summary. Would love more options for nutrition data entry, excersize data entry, and an explanation page for how all the features work. AND VERY IMPORTANT: an instruction manual for how to use the sleep tracker. This has the potential to be a highly effective all around wellness app. I will delete other apps to reduce phone clutter as soon as these features in updated."
"Shareware I will gladly change my 1 star to 5 as soon as you answer this... you are giving me my \""mood and feelings of each phone conversation I am having (I ENJOY THE FEED BACK, ACTUALLY). You are listening to my private telephone conversations, obviously. What then do you do with my private telephone conversations? Aside from telling me my mood during the call what are you doing with the information you gleaned in my conversation? Are you storing all of my conversations? If so, Why? What are you doing with the information you learn in my private telephone conversations? It is VERY important that you respond to this question admin. Thank you. Also are there any other personal things about me that you are recording, storing, that I am u aware of? Please answer asap. Thanks again. Waiting for your reply..."
"It's a little bit complicated. I love how in depth the features are, but some changes and features are hard to access and use."
"I think it's awesome the way it screens your calls and tells you how you felt emotionally during the call...it has great information about health, mental health... overall it's great I love it! Thanks"
Need a more accurate method of recording real time blood glucose and needs more defined medication doese.
This app is great for helping track every day health. Gives great tips!
"Installed a few days ago and already it has accessed my microphone over 400 times?I have read the reply to another review that explains how the app analyzes voice fractals, or some other technical jargon, and yet I still feel like my privacy is in jeopardy."
Very informative
I like this app quite a bit; the only downside is not being able to put in exactly what I ate. Would like more feedback on my food/nutrient choices. Not exactly sure if I'm eating well enough.
THIS APP DOESN'T WORK. THAT THERE IS ALREADY SOMEONE WITH MY ACCOUNT
Like much of it. Does not track steps well. Missed 1/2 of steps walked. Needs way to enter the steps we have from other fitness equipment.
Doesn't work says there is already an account with my info
Stepper does not work at all would love if it could have food tracker
I can't open the app even though it's installed. I'm going to delete it.
Says my account already exists that cannot be very disappointed that I am unable to use this app please fix this
Good but needs more of a fitness platform
App doesnt work . Says i already have an account but wont let me in. So i try to change the password and can't do that either .... ill just delete it!!!
it won't let me log my sleep
"I wish it would sync to other apps, like Fitbit."
Doesn't track my steps... could be my phone... but great tips!
It's a Cool app...
Worries me can judge mood of phone conversation. Do they listen ???
So far so good
Love this app
Good app
"I really dislike this app. I can't acutely save my blood sugar, there is no way I can take my cholesterol every, like its asking. I have a fit bit or something like it so it would be better for me to input my step in but it doesn't give that option. And it won't can't my steps. For my meds, I have a medical that I take once a week and it doesn't give me that option. My insurance company switch to this app I like the older platform they were using. Did I mention I dislike this app. üò†"
Watched Dr Oz on 1/24/18. Downloaded app and tried to set up account. Got error message that an account is already set up with those credentials. Tried to login with those credentials but said they don't exist. Tried three times which included the difficult scrolling for birth date (1952) but had the same issue each time. I'm uninstalling the app and will search for a better app.
It tells me someone already has an account using my e-mail no way because I haven't even set it up yet. MAJOR FAIL ON THE DEVELOPERS PART
"Useless app for me, maybe because I have a Fitbit and that app does way better than this one for counting steps, nutrition, etc. Would be cool if those 2 aps could work together! I also really hated how it \""automatically\"" tracked my relationships...any phone calls it analyzed were way off, not accurate about how I felt about the convos. Also, I don't talk on the phone very often, mostly use text or Facebook messenger, and none of that factored in to my \""real age\"", which I'm actually kind of happy about cause I'd rather not have them inaccurately intruding on those chats too! Nice try, like the idea but no thanks, did nothing for me."
Still learning all the in and outs but I am not liking the step tracker. It doesn't track the exercise I do at home. I do an exercise video but I see nowhere to enter that
"I just finished watching Dr. OZ & downloaded the app. It keeps saying \""AW Snap, Something went wrong Please Try Again.\"" And it keeps happening over & over again. I gave up trying to enter in the necessary data. **Please Remove The Bugs & Issue A Necessary Update.**"
"Too many errors. Won't let me manually put in my sleep because it won't automatically track it like it says. It doesn't track my steps and I've got it on auto. I've had 2 procedures in my past and it says I don't and never once asked me to put in that info and you can't edit it. I've had to create two new emails just so my husband and I could actually join because it will tell you that those emails are already in use, which is completely impossible. I can't even fill my green heart all the way up because I'm unable to put in steps and sleep. Or cholesterol or blood pressure. I don't have access to those daily. It also won't read my age right. I put in 11, it keeps selecting 10. The only cool thing is it measures my stress level when I talk to someone on the phone. Other than that, this app actually raises my stress level more than lowers it. Fix all these issues, then I'll start raising the rating. Figured if Dr. Oz approved it would be a good app... so far it is very stressful. The only thing those that are rating it 5* are saying is how cool it is that it notices my stress level in my voice. Apparently they haven't tried the other stuff or that is the only thing they like and they like it so much they'll rate it 5* just for that. I laughed at the one that said very few bugs. Hahaha! Try the whole app out for a day, I guarantee your rating will change."
"I have to have this to earn incentive dollars for my insurance. I do not like having to provide access to my contacts, photos, etc to any app, much less one I am coerced into using."
Said someone with my credentials has already signed up. Must be my doppelganger. Don't waste my time.
Couldn't get in. Says there's already an account
I love earning green days every day. An easy way to keep me motivated every day.
1/24/2018 Watchin Dr.Oz as we txt .. Thought while im prego IT WOULD BE PEEFECT FOR ME AND MINI ME.. THANKS FOR LOVING & CARING 4 PEOPLE EQUALLY.
It doesn't work won't let me create account
Just watch doctor oz went to download it filled them all the information and it stated that my information was already filled out and there was an account existed though I've never made an account and then it said something went wrong
Don't like it wish it would update from fibit compatible
Useless. Crashes over and over. Waste of time.
Says I already have an account. I do not. Can't sign up
Can't even get in! Says theres already an account in my name! Never even tried it before todayüò£
"Love it,makes me more aware of myself"
"So far it has not tracked my steps, and I did a lot today during my exercise video."
Step count is way off compared to Fit bit. Can't go back and add information once the day is over.
I just tried to down load this app after watching Dr.Oz but says this id has same credentials when I try to add my password I've never even tried this app till I heard it today from Dr.Oz please fix the bugs.
Tried signing up. It says I already have an account when I don't. When I put in my birthday. It's wrong on the next page . Like I put March 5 and the next page says March 4.
"Great easy to use app to track my vitals and overall wellness. Tracks your symptons as well. If you are interested in your health and being healthier, you should get this app"
"Pretty complete, but it creeped me out that it tracks and rates my relationship with my husband... Has him pegged though."
This app listens to phone calls and rates my stress.... Screw that big brother!
"I do like the steps being counted, the daily quizes and trackers. Except, I do not like the fact that my phone calls are listened to! Those are my private calls! Then this makes me question what else is being listened to."
"Does use the battery a bit, but has great coaching with demeanor on the phone, counts steps and meal tips."
"I love earning green days, helps me know I'm on the right track!"
Okay this app was resolved and I was using this for about a few months but now again there's a glitch and it's not letting me sign back on I've act I never signed off it just sign me off I thought the last update resolve this issue I really do like this app but it seems there's a lot of glitches and now I keep trying to sign on and it's not signing me on if within 24 hours this is not fixed I'm going to have to email the developer and hopefully they'll get on top of this again It's a shame because this app has a lot to offer and has helped me quite a bit reduce my stress and the articles are just awesome
"I'm usually able to go right into my app but there's a glitch now, it won't let my sign in. It's been like this before your last update. Please fix the glitch."
"Helps me pay attention, to my health even when life is busy"
Interesting to see results of phone calls
"It's cool to have to record vitals, but when I try to read some of the boards, it won't bring up any page. Instead it closes the app."
"I'm‚Äãnot going to the doctor for an activation code and I can't get it to work right online, which I don't want to do anyway."
"I love this app, except that the step count doesn't always reflect the # of steps correctly. I walk roughly the same # daily, but sometimes it doesn't show that"
really enjoying this app
"I had this app on my phone. Then my phone shattered. It keeps telling me it will send me my password in email, when I click forgot password. It didn't send and won't, I've tried repeatedly the past month. And now suddenly you need an activation code? That's pretty ridiculous of sharecare. Actually, more than ridiculous. It's stupid to lose access to an app you've been using. Honestly signing up with them is pointless to only use on the internet. So it will never be used now."
Step tracker is highly unreliable
"Love the trackers and most of the articles. I do wish they would stop sending articles for women over 65, since I am in my early 40s though."
"Latest update installed, previous update crashes no longer affecting the app, works perfectly again!"
Sent too many notifications
"Since the latest app update, the app crashes upon opening. Makes the app useless. Please fix this issue! It was working fine before the update."
Very user friendly. Great information tailored just for my health.
"Pretty cool technology. Need to improve the \""steps\"" tracker and let user manually enter steps and other exercise if they run without phone."
I think it would be great if it would let me log in. Is this a Google Play app so I must use my Gmail address ? So I keep trying and it says my email and or pw doesn't match Dr. Oz and Sharecare. Someone have any advice
Great app. I love that I can customize it and how much information I get. Great motivator.
It's awesome
"I down loaded it and when I went to sign up using my email address, it said current users have to sign in. I've never heard of this app before and shouldn't already be signed up, but thought ok, I'll sign in with my email address and see what happens. It then told me my email address was not signed up and I would have to sign up before I sign in. I tried again, typing carefully incase I typed something wrong the first time, but I got the same results. I just deleted it, not worth the stress."
It won't let me create an account. It won't accept any passwords! Emailed for help and was told to make sure I don't already have an account. I am positive I don't have another acct and emailed support back to advise I wad not the only one having this issue and the issue is with the actual app itself and have not received a response since. So I am uninstalling the app until the fix the issues and it actually works properly
I know I have issues not often in green usually orange or red but I won't give up they work on bugs if you report an issue I like the new updates thank you gonna show my doctor and friends cool have a good day but sometimes I have to relog in...
"It misses the mark quite often on evaluating my voice pitch translating what it thought I was trying to convey. It never counts my daily steps correctly. I work in the produce Dept of a grocery store and I'm on my feet all day 6 and 7 hours 5 days a week. I may or may not be doing 10,000 steps per day but I know I'm walking more than the 400 or 500 steps the app claims. The links at the end of each tutorial never work"
"I'm always in the green, even when I'm intentionality lying or making myself sound nervous or distressed. Don't even bother. (edit for developer) And to be clear in what conversations this is monitoring mostly I'm going thru have to do with insurance and disability offices from an injury I've received. alot of conversations with people are people Jerking me around and I'm very stressed out."
"Analysis of the human voice, without knowing anything about the person, ignores such things as regional differences (which can easily be misinterpreted). Stating that the goal is 10,000 steps per day does not consider someone with a physical disability. Not everyone is thin, in shape, or without medical issues. I fail to see the significance of this app, and did not see its value. I have uninstalled it."
I'm very disappointed with this app. It won't let me register for a new account. It keeps telling me that my passwords don't match. I know for a fact that they do match! I'm very careful when I put a password in. Talk about causing STRESS!! I'll keep the app up for a day or two - to give ya'll a chance to fix the problem.
"I love the feedback given to me after each call, it is accurate and show me the impact a phone call can have in me. I love the informative tips given to help me regain control of both good and bad stressors in my life. This app have readily become a part of who I am. I'm always checking the notifications for update. I'm loving it and highly recommend it.üòä"
"I have had nothing but problems with this app. I've reset my password at lease 3 times before I could even use the damn thing. I was finally able to take the real age test after 3 days of attempts. It says it will track your sleep habits but how. I can't seem to fine to place on the app to set the sleep mode. Or any of the other modes like stress, sleep or any of the other modes. This app is not user friendly at all. There are no instructions on how to use it or even exactly how it works. PEE-U and PEE-U Dr. Oz for promoting such crap. I have email to the customer support but all I get are more questions for me rather then giving me a good answer to my question. So please CS don't reply here with your standard reply message. Fix this thing or shut it down."
"So far, this app has really opened my eyes to what I have been wondering about myself and how I communicate with other all along. It's right on point with everytime I pick up a phone call. After I've read what was interpreted from my phone calls, I think about how I talked, who I was talking to, and my emotions, and this app has been on point about it."
This app keeps track of everything. Especially talking on the phone. I don't mean that in a bad way I mean that in a good way. It gives you hints if your stressed out while talking on a conversation on how to make that not happen again and much much more. I would recommend this app to anyone
"There are many times I was extremely stressed out, but it only showed up as green! This app is OK for people whose stress level is higher than mine, and it would be also OK, for people who speak only one language...it gave me even info on a call that I did not answer, because I did not recognize the number. This app said that the call was very productive.....ha, I did not even answer the call!!!??? I have not used this app when dealing with the government. Now that causes my stress level to rise drastically"
I'm thinking all the complainers have a baseline of green means I'm mad and red means I blew up a country. This app is spot on.
Well I saw this on a tv show and figured I would give it and try. I fully understand it is in beta stages but it truly is disappointing. It fails to on the most basic levels. I have made dozens of calls and none of them seem to be recorded in the database to tell me how the stress or whatever is going on in my calls or voice. That's the whole reason it decided to download this. I hope they get that fixed or I will keep this review and no uninstall the app unfortunately.
It only worked once. Most times it didn't even analize calls. The idea sounded good but they have a lot more to do to get this app right. Maybe i don't have the right phone. I am using samsung s6
"Does not always analyze calls, sleep it gets pretty accurate, and steps seem about right...however more information sleep pattern would be insightful. Calls analyzed seemed pretty accurate..add the sleep information and might increase rating..."
"In just three days of use, the app has totally missed the mark in identifying my stress levels on phone calls. Tonight, I shared an engaging, laughter-filled call with my best friend and it was characterized as extremely irritable. This app also qualified a call with my client who thanked me for being a calming influence as irritable. As a life coach, I consider myself fairly self-aware. I am not perfect but I am certain this app is completely off base for me!"
Is spot on most of the time. I love it and I've registered for the 10 week research study. Also if u mess up with signing up at all it won't let u register. U have to delete it and redownload then make sure u type everything right the first time
"It seems to not go by my voice alone but any voice. So how can it determine my stress levels by using other voices, just as computer voices when using auto services. Plus it keeps crashing when on phone calls. I get message saying it has been turned off."
Love this app. Helps me know how I am doing with telephone manners and mostly tone of voice. Learning is great tool for other areas.
Info most calls I think it is right on. I do think that it doesn't always account for additional noise and situations happening on the other end of calls. I also would like An option to mark calls as not mine so when someone uses my phone it doesn't affect my results and patterns.
This would be such a handy tool if it worked. It probably analyzed 1 out of every10 phone calls. I also found it not very user friendly. The few phone calls it did analyze were spot on. I hope they keep working on this app and make it as good as it could be.
"I don't believe it, while talking on the phone it does seem to know how I feel. If I am feeling good or something. How my tone relates to my voice which show its inflexion on others. love it. Would like to know how it work without being on the phone."
The app seems very accurate in picking up emotions even when I'm trying to sound different. Not sure how it works but it's hard to be in denial when it's telling you how you're really feeling. Great app. Awareness is half the battle.
"Some what correct, very interesting app. Really like it... changing my mind it keeps crashing so I am uninstalling"
It seems to be pretty accurate most of the time. However I believe my monotone throws off the analysis
Seems to be very accurate so far but this being my first day I need more time to check it out.
Like a lot of other users it want even allow me to create a profile. I'm deleting this app
I like this app. I am not exactly sure how the analysis of calls is so accurate most of the time. I have emailed with questions and received response timely.
"Doesn't analyze MOST calls. It usually says \""call too short to analyze\"" no matter if it's a 5 min. call or an hour long call."
The app will not give me results for my calls. I have had multiple tonight and nothing.
So much help for me! I've wanted to improve my health both physically & emotionally. I'm 71 years old & have been in poor health for most of my adult life. With your program test I've found out that my biological age is 77.9. I started with your help 1 week ago & now know what to improve for my sake. My Dr. is in total agreement & is going to monitor my improvements! Thank you for helping me!
I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times. Does not show any of my phone calls.
I was very impressed as to how accurate the app is. I enjoy reading the description of my voice analysis and then checking to see if it was correct.
Very revealing about your attitude and projection while you on your calls and most of the time it hits the mail on the head. Plus the app comes with healthy living tips. Enjoy it and definitely will be using and sharing it with others
I am very happy with the App. It gives me hope that I can reduce the amount of stress I suffer from thru out the day. I try to stay in the green. I love this idea.
This app would not accept any password I put in when trying to register. Frustrated and done
First the app told me to check my internet connection like I wasn't connected when I was that's how I downloaded the app.Created a sign in try to sign in it act like it's processing it and then tells me I need to sign in have done this about 5 times. Unable to use will be deleting.
"I'm dissapointed. I was really excited about using this app. I installed it, made an account and so far it hasn't counted any steps nor shown me and indication that the voice analysis was working.. Frustrating.."
It is so right on the dot. I have learned a lot about my voice and how it comes across. Thank you.
Great app. When I need to know my stress level I helps me to reevaluate any situation
"The evaluation given by this app based on the tone of words that are spoken is greater than that of a mother who knows her child's disposition just by the tone in his/her voice. Download the app, and be amazed with the detailed and accurate analysis that is immediately forthcoming after each call."
I was amazed yet impressed that this app was able to pick up on such accurate descriptions of my feelings and how I present myself over the phone. I enjoy being able to monitor my relationships.
"I've been using this app for awhile now. Gave it a chance and I've been pissed off on calls that will analyze it as \""productive\"" The doesn't analyze most calls. Uninstalling"
I can. not say a word and it tells me I an stressed. It even judge a recording machine.
I tried signing up for this app and it first told me that all Dr Oz people must login Bubba Bubba blah then. I tried it again with a different password and then it said that I wasn't connected to the internet. I know for sure that I am always connected to my internet.
"So far, so good. I've only had it a few hours but it really seems to be on target with my phone call stress levels."
"I love this app, makes me understand my stress level and how to fix the problem."
I have never been interested in an app that tracks anything. I am impressed. This app is getting me onto a more positive thinking process.
I made a call made sure i kept it going for more than 5 mins and its saying i didnt make a call.. Fix it jesus!
"The voice analysis really nails it and even gives me insight on my true feelings at times. I can't figure out how it knows my sleep pattern, but it's accurate. I do hope it helps me with stress."
You talk about this app on your show up today and an I can't seem to register So why Is that I put all the right Information In and I can't register
It wasnt accurate at all i was even arguing with someone over the phone and it said very friendly positive attitude. Lol its a fake app
A little annoying the phone analysis isnt very accurate but i enjoy the articles
"Doesn't always analyze every call. Seems to get some info dead on and then some info way off. Once the little bugs are ironed out,i think it will be a good app."
All of the descriptions of how I felt during a discussion were right on target. I know when I'm stressed most of the time but there were a few times that the app caught when I didn't realize that I was stressed.
"This app really shows your true demeanor of how you feel on a call. Now if my \""baby daddy\"" would download it to see how he really talks to me...."
"Share care app be on it I swear. I would definitely recommend this app for Americans across the world, it really helps you to control your stress levels and the tone of your voice."
"Very interesting app, definitely let's u know the mood ur in with each person u speak with."
It doesn't work on about 1/3 of my calls. I'm sure they're working on getting the bugs out. The ones that do work are spot on.
I like it so far.. it could be really helpful in behavior modification.. the one thing that I don't like about it so far is that it won't count my steps.. And I really wanted to no that factor in my overall health
"It takes forever to get results from the previous day. I should also be able to view my progress throughout the day, not the results almost 24 hours later"
Says I need to log in. I have no idea what this app is. So there is no way I already have a account.
Love this. It's pretty accurate and I think sort of fascinating to hear some of the call reports it generates. Definately 5 stars
Awesome app. Helps you really think about your stressors and how to better cope with them.
Great app! It has given me many insights I was unaware of in personal relationships
This app has really helped me identify my stressors during a call and has helped me communicate much more effectively.
"Does not register sleep right. It puts you to sleep when you lay down. Like if I lay down at 10om, that's my fall to sleep time, but I'm still looking at the clock at 11:30pm. Sleep part does not work, not at all acurate."
"It was tracking my sleep, steps and calls regularly but now it only does it on occasion."
"Keeps telling me about dr. Oz which im thinking i need to use my user name and pw from his sight, but shen i go om his and hit forget pw, i dont get an email to reset. So i guess there is no way to sign on regardless."
It makes me look back on my day and then i can decide how to do better tomorrow.
"However, it does have insightful articles relating to health and wellness. I think the app has great potential if... it can fix the voice interpretation. As of now very disappointed!"
This app seems to read me pretty good. Hopefully I'll be able to recognize when I need to watch my tone.
Your analysis has been right on every time. Haven't had any problems with it. Thanks.
Keeps saying my passwords arnt long enough and don't match
The only issue i have It's that It don't analyze but a few of my calls
Would like to allow user to make daily comments to explain their stress levels. Also sleep time is not correct. Can I correct it?
Love the app. The sleep tracker has me fascinated... and allows me to make corrections if it gets it wrong.
"So far, it's been only a week of using this app, but I'm loving it. Lots of helpful information to improve my real age outcome! It's been right about my moods, state of mind, feelings, etc...And recommendations on how to improve it has been a huge plus!! üëç I've been needing something like this and very glad I found it. üòäüíìüíìüíì"
Won't allow new registration. As many times as I keep trying it says my password do not match. Sorry my passwords match!! There's an issue with this app and I'm frustrated. Please address and fix your issues as I've read numerous complaints about it.
Unable to determine on my cell which has maxed out storage. Will check it out on my computer tomorrow.
Interesting articles and tracking of my sleep. It still never counts steps on my Droid Turbo.
"I don't always agree with it, but sometimes it surprises me how accurate it is."
"Seems to read my words, like my mind."
"It should allow to override information. Ex. Sleep & walking - l personally sleep in spurts and I don't carry my cell phone all the time, so it's impossible to tell the walking amount. Other than that...quite accurate!"
It works for my sister but I have made 4 calls and none of them registered
Not perfect but relatively correct on analysis. Great content for self improvement.
Love it! Right on point. It's like someone is reading my mind.
Accurate most of the time. The Sleep part is not very useful unless the last thing you do before you go to sleep is move the phone and then pick up your phone when you wake up immediately
This helps with learning the feelings of stress.
I can't believe how accurate this app is! I know I'm ticked at someone and it tells me! Also knows when I'm impatient to get off the phone! lol
This app really knows me! It's amazing how it can decipher your real feelings from just your voice. The next step is for it to tell me how the other person is feeding. I WOULD LOVE THAT!!!!!! Please try to add that!
It's very accurate the software used to measure your stress level is spot on its helped me delvop a plan to live a healthier lifestyle awsome app
Its really nice sometimes not accurate but its an good informative app.
Detects stress in your voice patterns
I love this app!!!! A huge thank you to the developers for all of your research and time taken to make this highly insightful app! One day. I've had it for one day and am already a little more aware of how I sound to others over the phone.
"It's strange how an app can understand my emotions during phone calls...they're really accurate. It makes me think and alter my mood. The steps, though, it's how many steps my phone makes (with me) ... Not many!"
The short articles I've seen so far are great!
Easy to use. It pretty much does everything for you.
I find very useful and informative and on track.. I'm going to keep it
It won't let me sign up!
"Seems to be close to how i feel, called a couple of times to test it and it did well analyzing"
There is no option to turn on or off in settings. I have made and received 10 calls and no data alalysis...Am I doing something wrong?
Can't rate calls that are totally wrong ... sleep meter it's wrong too
I am also unable to create an account
Amazing almost creepy! I hope there's nothing spiritistic behind it!
I highly recommend this app!
If you're honest with yourself you will find the app is pretty much on point.
"App has been working well,with every call.very informative,pretty accurate!"
I was very surprised to see how well this app works. Very accurate
Reads phone conversations right most of the time!
All over my body
Give you more after a week or two
1 of the best applications I've had in a while
"I enjoyed the peace full music, I found this very relaxing."
Dont know bout everyone else! I love it and im not always on green....it lets me know when im acting anxious when i am and calm when i am.....i give it a rate of 4....Good job on this app!!!
So fair so good we shall see how the app goes
Gives great feedback about yourself and moods...Very informative!
Unbelievable and quite useful.
"Very informative, love it!"
Great app will share with others.
It's so accurate
This is a very good app I love it
Very interesting app. Enjoying it!
My favorite app highly recommend
Does not allow for comments on phone call analysis
Very accurate so far!
Makes me laugh
It amazing how accurate the app is .
Very accurate readings and information.
Interesting articles and cool feedback
Gives you lots to think about
It's been on target with its analysis...so far.. but reading the comments makes me hope it continues to work well. It doesn't pick up every call though.
Impressed with the accuracy of this app.
It's very helpful and very accurate. I love it.
lots of info for health & ways to say healthy
Awesome. Shared it with lots of others especially teachers!!!
You would be amazed.
This app is the awesome lol
Seems very easy to use and helpful
Most of the time is correct.
It really helped me see how I sound to the person who I talk to
Even when I talk on the phone it knows my attitude. . Cool
Won't let me sign up
Gives great insight!
This app has been right every time!!!!
Love it! Pretty accurate.
This app is spot on...
The information that i have received and the call diagnosis have been spot on.
Great feedback almost if it feels every thing I feel!!! Crazy!!!!
Very few glitches! !
New year üë¥
Accurate & informative. Great app!!!
Love it.
I Uninstalled
I love this app.
Is there a way to tell the call participants apart or received vs the transmitted voices?
Love this app!
It's reading my mind. Spot on. Amazing.
Very insightful!
Best thing yet
Very accurate
Stress Analysis
Awesome!!!!
Great App üëçüëçüëç
Very useful application
LOVE it
Accurate most of the time
Really helpful
Loved it
Accurate
This is fantastic
good app
Pretty accurate
Marketable

Will not let me sign up. Keeps telling me to all users and Dr Oz guests need to sign in. I just downloaded it today.
Love it

"This app is great - even with the few annoyances. Love the feature that monitors my voice on phone calls & provides feedback. Dead on most of the time. Once I thought it had it wrong. Then I remembered that the whole first half of the call was spent trying to yell into the phone so the automated system could read my voice - which it wasn't doing well. It would be cool if the voice feature you have could be used by my insurance co., bank, etc. so I could avoid having a stroke before getting an operator."
"At first it was interesting, but after a while it started to seem like the app was finding something critical about ALL my calls. Lastly, it would be nice if there were a dictation function to check voice, rather than only doing it during phone calls. (UPDATE) : I DID deactivate step tracking in the app. It still gives me a step report, indicating I did zero steps. I want that to go away. I ALSO emailed the developer account in MAY and have received no response."
"I am fairly new to this app but for the amount of time I've been using it, it's almost to good to be true. I didn't think it would be this accurate with my relationships and real age time but IT'S SPOT ON! I believe I might be able to pin point specific triggers, people, places, times. That is incredible!"
"There needs to be changeable options for sleep, for one thing. I have bouts of insomnia where I wake up and don't go back to sleep for over an hr, and I can't account for that. Also, there should be an option to take notes for one's self, as well, I believe. It's interesting to see the stress levels on the phone calls, but I can't take note on what to do about it, or how to improve. Perhaps a meal entry and exercise tracker would be a good idea, too. A total health system."
But I changed phones from Samsung to a droid. And now I don't have the tracking widget. Please tell me how to get it on here.
"I really really want to try this app. I saw it on Dr. Oz yesterday! Why can't I complete the registration? Is there something going on? During the registration process, when selecting \""Avatar\"" or \""Upload own pic\"", it won't go any further. Please fix, I want to give this a try. I am on my computer trying to set this up since there is so much feedback with similar issues. Still not having any luck, seems as though it's on the app side, not the registrant's side. Update: much better now"
It keeps me on tack with my health. It monitors my phone conversations-as to my stress levels; and daily steps and sleep. I love reading all of the informative health information. It has caused me to be accountable for my health. I look forward to opening it up and seeing what there.
This is a pretty cool app. Works as it should except often times when I tap on an item in the app it does not respond.
Won't let me set a password to give me access and keeps telling me I'm already a member which is false. Oh well.
"Incredibly...almost shockingly accurate! I definitely would recommend to at the very least try it out...you absolutely will get to identify your stress factor in great detail but sadly monitor with rather general tips on how to feel \""the opposite\""...I suppose! As many questions as one has to answer signing on, I was hoping for a much more personalized...more detailed way to deal with things! But hey, overall its a super \""fantastic App\""...I'm kinda obsessed with it now! üëç√ó2 ‚≠ê√ó12"
More times than not whether business called personal or to family member it was almost right on the money spooky I think the NSA's behind it... haha
Would like to comment after phone call comments
Continually not communicating with the server. Will no longer record data. Please fix this.
This is not analyzing my voice... this could be a great app if it actually did what it says it does
A must have app
Fails to monitor phone calls
I love the app but it doesn't open from time to time... Please fix then I will change my rating back to ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
More than ever. The express has been correct.
It's a very good app to be on
Phone stress reports are on target 100%. This app rocks!!!!
Very interesting
If you are a person an open-minded about how you speak to stuff and how you speak to people this is a very good program for you to use it opens your mind and let you see how you are speaking to people before it comes out of your mind and it helps me out because making sure that I'm not over excited and it shows me when when I first did this when I was over excited talking to people trying to get my point across or you can get your point across by thinking about stuff before you say downloaded)
Fun and interesting to see amazing results after each phone call. Also gives great tips and information on all health topics.
"This app is very inspiring, motivating and touches on most pertinent topics. I have trouble with it continuing to work. Second time I've had to reload it."
"I think the voice assessments are pretty accurate, but the sleep & step calculations are totally off. I also like the links to healthful tips & weekly assessment of connections (calls) & stress level."
This app gave me great insight into how stressed my daily calls are. There aren't my psychological health apps on the market and this one is both frictionless and groundbreaking.
"This app has brought to my attention just how over stressed I really am and it pours out of me when I communicate with others. Even when I think I have my stress under control, I realized how wrong I really was. I love this app!!!!!"
I enjoy being made more aware of how my voice is perceived.
Doesn't track any steps and not accurate sleep tracking.
Analyzes stress in your voice
The primary reason I'm glad I switched from apple to android.
"Just downloaded, so far so üëç"
Medical information
Love the app but doesn't always let me hit the star buttons and suddenly shuts down. When it works it's very accurate. Makes you stop and think about your stress and tips are helpful. Now its not telling me anything about my phone calls and stress. This would be Great app to share with your doctor. Please fix this problem with app.
"This application is one of the best. It even calculates how much I sleep and it's dead on. I knew I needed to make some changes, but this doesn't just tell you that you do but gives you solutions on behavior modification through articles and videos. You can even pin the ones that really pertain to you as an individual. Two thumbs up along with 5 stars!"
The judgements on things are interesting. They make you think but are often way off base. The sleep times are often way off. It says it's a beta version and it is. I think it senses when my phone gets notifications. The ratings on phone calls says most are stressful and they really aren't at all. Does make you think how you are perceived by others.
I have been using this app for about for days after I saw on doctor oz...the interactive part of this app is what is interesting...I'm VERY surprised about how true the voice test through the calls are...just wish out could tell a difference when I get a voicemail or actually talking to someone cause that plays a part in my voice I would think...then the monitoring of sleep is fantastic and still can't figure out how it knows I'm sleeping HOWEVER it never gets when I'm napping...that would make better
"Also says my most stressful days (plural) are Thursday. Which again,app only had one Thursday to evaluate my calls bcz it stopped working,so it based that on a couple of calls to my Internet provider. Which yes they do stress me at times. Hahaha! Well,guess it was good for a week. Then,blah! üòõ"
"I have had issues with it since installing it yesterday. The app keeps freezing up, and not letting me view things after clicking on them. Then today it began just closing as soon as I open the app. It did this several times. So I tried restarting my phone, and it did the same thing. I then did the update that I didn't know it needed (thinking that would fix the problem), but it is still closing out. I absolutely love the idea of this app but I can't even open it now. Sad face üò¢"
So my father read a news article on this app and recommend it to me and I'm glad he did. It's doing a fine job of accurately analyzing my phone calls and giving a summary of my relationship with each caller. Be sure to make sure no other app is interfering with this app trying to record. I have another app set up simply to record long technical conversations with people to file away and this app will not record them at the same time. Make sure you know what app has recording priority.
"Seems like this app would work. Just had my first phone call and it didn't register it or something? It just says no calls. Also, my contact list or \""relationships\"" area hasn't synced up with my phone either. Am I doing something wrong? Would give higher rating if I knew how to use it better I guess. There's not much of a tutorial for operating this app."
The phone call evaluations are helping me to dial down my impatient and sarcastic tone...
It is not always accurate as it says I'm mostly irritated which I don't think I am. We'll see in a few more months.
"As a judgemental, semi-cynical old man (perceived, not actual, I hope, 59 yr old father of 4) I am amazed at the clarity this app has given me in re-analyzing relationships I have with those I care about most."
Great app. Gives helpful feedback regarding lifestyle elements that might cause stress. My favorite tool for self improvement.
This app Nails the description of how I felt or sounded in any conversation I have. Very descriptive. Spot on. Very helpful. Very suggestive. Keeps track of steps. Sleep. And relationship statuses. And even stress levels each day throughout the week. I hope you find this rating helpful in your decision on wether to download this app. I hope you download it and enjoy it as much as I do. =)
I'm very dissatisfied with the app. I've made many calls since downloading it and have yet to see any analysis of them...
This app describes me to the tee lol. It reminds me to be mindful of how I receive and react to others. I like it a lot‚ò∫
After watching Dr. Oz using this app with Charlie Sheen I downloaded it. I have enjoyed all the different elements it has o offer. Check it out for yourself.
Glad I installed. It's interesting to see how I'm handling calls from a 3rd party perspective.
It is not very accurate with how you are feeling. Cannot delete the calls or adds they just run on and on. Sleep feature is not right just because you turn you're phone off does not mean you are sleeping. Unless I'm missing something not very good app.
I really like this app it also has been helpful with tips and suggestion for me. However the last few times I've used my phone it has not picked up that I was on the phone
Doesn't register phone calls or sleep patterns right or most of time at all. I deleted it. Maybe after all the glitches get fixed I'll retry it.
This is a fun but very enlightening app. It will truely do an accurate voice analysis for your stress health levels and other healthy info.
It shows very little steps when I actually walk thousands in a day. The phone call analysis are interesting. Not sure I agree with it all the time but it is interesting.
"I find annoying that it alerts you to new assessments and there are no \""new\"" assessment -- it's the same ones. Also when i want an assessment it doesn't come through. I've noticed it's usually a long phone call."
Frustrated!
This app is on point and very helpful... this app provides helpful reading material that really helps reduce stress!
Most of the time this app is totally wrong on what its feed back is. Says the same things on most calls. Its a disappointment
I'm enjoying reading about my calls. I can tell all my stress related calls not to call me! Lol!
"I love this app! Very insightful, call analyzes dead on. Only complaint is can't figure out how to remove articles."
Can't believe how accurate this app is. Now after every call I rush to the app to see how well it read my voice...awesome
I didn't realize how much different people affect my mood!
It really keeps me on my toes in regard to my stress levels via voice analysis.
It's kind of like I'm talking to a third party about getting advice about a loved one or friends
Used this for 2 days then it stopped analyzing my calls. Was cool when it did work. Can someone tell me why it stopped?
Seems like every phone call is rated the same even if it is a fun social call.
It it a great tool to help me realize when I need to take a moment for myself and lower my anxiety.
I believe but this app is going to help me actually control some of the stress in my life
"Worked well for a few minutes. Tried to complete the \""RealAge\"" test. The app won't go past the 2nd question. The app just says \""Aw, snap something went wrong\"" and it hasn't worked since. Disappointed"
"I like this app, it gives me lots of info and I find it pretty accurate. Glad I installed this."
Unable to count my total amount of daily steps
I wake and go back to sleep no way to note this
I like it but it still keeps repeating the same feelings and emotions for all my calls
Most all calls assessments are wrong.
Wont let me sign up
These application is very comfortable and clean. I definitely would recommend buying these game.
I love the voice analyzer the best!
"Kind spooky how close they get, and the information is great."
This is pretty amazing how accurate it is. Informitive as well
Gave me the capability to see and evaluate my relationships
Never registers calls and shuts my voicemail down...
The voice stress info is helpful for stress management.
I like the call part. Been retry much on track!!!
I don't agree with all of the all the readings for my calls.
This app is so accurate. I love it!
Couldn't even sign in!
So far kinda correct!
Its a application that helps analyze stress.
Insightful information...
It's an AWESOME app that's right on!!
Behavior analysis Application
It's helpful
Love it!
Phone app for stress
Insightful!
Pretty dern cool
Great app I enjoy it
Learning a lot about myself
Very useful
Amazing
Really like this app
Liked it
Cool APP
Phone
Great so far. I love the tips for fitness and stress reduction..but the best part is the quality of call feature. It is helping me regulate my communication after a coma. Thank you! And thanks to Dr Oz & Charlie Sheen for talking about your app on his show!!
"It doesn't work. I make calls and everytime I check to see my stress level it says \"" sorry unable to load data. Please try again later\"" . It's always doing this and it's annoying."
"It doesn't show my new data after a call at all, not even after closing and restarting or refreshing multiple times, and i can't seem to find a way to track my sleep at all."
"I have found the intensity rating of my phone conversations very helpful. I am now aware of how I may sound to whomever I am conversing with. I am very pleased with this app, and I hope to take advantage of all it has to offer."
"Call info is relatively accurate, but steps and sleep info is not very accurate."
For some reason when i make a call my results aren't showing up when i open the app back up
This may just work.
Great App. Information very useful
Unbelievable how its so close to correct that its scary.
does it cost to sign up to use the app
This app is spot on. Love it!!
very accurate.awesome .love it.
Usually right !
"This is an interesting app. At first I thought the results on a single conversation were wrong, but over time I've noticed a pattern to my communication that was giving me scores that i didn't like and was giving inaccurate stress indicators. Then I figured out what is scored as positive and I'm working on having consistent high scores."
I tried signing up for this app and it wouldn't accept my data after submitting it. I tried 5 times and finally gave up and uninstalled the app.
I like this app a lot but it eats my battery alive and its always keeping my phone awake so my phone is hardly able to go to sleep. Could you guys fix this? I really don't want to have to uninstall this app. It really helps me see my stressers.
I Was really beginning to like this app(especially the sleep monitor) then it stopped working. I Did the update and it still doesn't work. I'm sadly about to uninstall app.
I'd give it more stars but I don't think it can detect sarcasm and humor when I talk. Meh üòû
"I am so happy to have found this app, it helps me to soften my speaking skills as well as understand how I perceive my relationships with those that I speak to daily so that I may improve on my communication with those that I care about. I'm so excited to continue using the sharecare app and see my relationships develop more positively."
I'm happy with the app. It's pretty much on the money regarding my feelings.
"I love this app, explains things to me that I didn't know and gives stress relief information! üòâüòâüòâ"
Good pick up of emotions over the phone
Awesome the insight this app provides.
This app seems pretty accurate and helpful.
What a great use of technology!
I really love this app
Dead on!!!!!
Really like this app. It has shows how I sound to others. I think I'm level toned and it will show I'm irrated or angry and that's not how I want to be perceived.
Interesting insights although some conversations that were in the yellow did feel that tense or uncertain to me.
It really highlights they way others perceive you on the phone.
Pinpoints my exact mood every time I'm on the phone
I thought the app was very accurate and insightful. I liked it a lot. I recommend it.
Has some useful advice and helpful tips.
Positive and upbeat. Love the suggestions and input.
"Stopped working after some updates. Can you guys fix it, please?"
Great app!!
Really good app
Enjoy the app immensely
Awesome and very accurate
"I love how precise the analysis is. Also, not sure how it sometimes knows when I'm sleeping. Many of the calls show \""unknown number\"". I do wish it would pick up numbers better. Often when I go back to read the analysis, I can't remember who the call was with...maybe I set something up wrong. Overall, it's really cool and I have recommended it to others."
"I love the idea of this app and when it works it can provide insight about your demeanor. However, 80% of the time it is dead wrong. It seems to misinterpret excitement and/or joy as anger and domination, and kindness/compassion is mistaken for anxiety and uncertainty. Fun idea, terrible execution. Would not recommend..."
"It is like \""Wow\"" I don't see how it works , it knows my sleep so precisely, I also love health articles"
It is surprisingly good at understanding my attitude. I just keep wondering (as a developer) how it works so well and how the underlying technology could be used. It's really cool!!
Very insightful and the accuracy is astonishing. I highly recommend.
"It's fascinating when it works, but it only works 10% of the time."
Interesting app gives good insight
It amazes me how it is spot on most of the time.
Accurate most of the time about 95%
Great info so far
Amazingly Accurate
Eye Opener
I don't always like the insights it gives especially when communicating with family but if I'm honest with myself this thing is more often than not dead on which leads me to see things I would otherwise (sometimes blissfully) ignore..... to my own detriment.
"So accurate it's scary. I love this app so much, it really help me better myself when it comes to communicate with others."
"Has made me be aware of my tone of voice, I'm a retired Army Sergeant and Vietnam Veteran and sometimes my tone of voice gets me into trouble. This app has helped me to change the way I speak and get along with others better."
It is dead on when describing my feelings when I place calls. Plus all the extras like tracking Ur sleep & meditation short videos & how to be/stay health & mindful! I REALLY DO LOVE THIS APP!
Very cool how it analyzes your voice and fluctuations. Its pretty accurate but it could expand in pleasant emotions.
This app seems to work. very well. Lets you be aware of your tone of voice. You can work on that if you are not satisfied with your tone.
"I find it not very accurate. Many conversations come up as irritated or intense, and when I ask the person I was talking too what they thought, they said that is Not what they thought at all."
"For the most part it is accurate, doesn't give feedback on every call, and some of the feedback is kinda generic. But I do like the app, it gives me insight on how I come across to others."
I've learned a lot about myself because of this app. It's truly remarkable. You can't hide your feelings. It informs you of your tone whether or not you realise it.
This is a good app. It's been spot on so far. I would love to see it give some tips on how to control some of the stressers.
Wish it interpreted the calls without WiFi or data but its a great app I love it!
"It misses calls, but otherwise it seems very accurate, although sometimes the stress is not about the caller. ie; being late for an appt & someone calls. The stress is there in the voice, but not because of the caller."
"I love this app, it shows me how I should talk to people and be relax when talking to someone. I never noticed how stressful I would be when talking to some people. This app has helped me A LOT."
This app helps you realize how you coming across to the people self awareness is a good thing so I give this 4 stars I'll keep using it
The descriptions of my mood and realtionship with different people in my life could not be more accurate. This is an impressive app!
Pretty accurate on how I may be feeling while on a call with different family members & friends. It's a great app & already suggested it to all my contacts..
You've been pretty spot on with my phone conversations. But concern is how do you determine the sleep time? What type of connection you have where you know when I go to sleep and when I'm awake? Are you listening in through my phone? That really creeps me out! Please explain how that's done.
This is an excellent app. 99% of the time it is correct regarding my state of mind when speaking with someone.
Amazing! It is dead on. I never realized how much stress I actually had in my voice until this app. I started asking ppl if I sounded like it said I did and they said yes!
"I love this app it helps me know how I come across to people on the phone, I think everyone should get this app."
One thing that annoys me is when it doesn't pick up phone calls that really matter to me
Pretty accurate even though sometimes I don't like how they describe me
This is a great app it's accurate probably about 90% of the time I'm just totally blown away about how it works. Try it you'll like it!
Great app... don't know if I should be worried cause it says I'm stressed on every call.
I was surprised at how accurate it is! Some of it is pretty funny on what it picks up in your voice. Almost a little eerie. .....
Great app! Seems like I am stressed all the time!
Make me aware of my feelings which call my attention and help me to be most conscious about them
Lots of fun & and you can learn a thing or 2 about yourself
"21 calls, most of which were pleasant and upbeat. This app says they were \""Intense\""...all of them. Don't waste your time on this junk. Time to uninstall."
Nothing like it anywhere. It is simply amazing. Everyone should download it.
I love this app. I shows how my voice and conversation is coming across.
This App has been spot on with every call. Very interesting.
Have lots of fun learning how I present myself to people.
"I like it! I check it often & it seems to be pretty accurate, especially when I'm mad!"
Its always dead on always
It's pretty accurate!
Great app seems very accurate
Gets my mood right 99% of the time
Validates your emotional response in a way that heightens your sense of self.
It really works
Very helpful in keeping myself calm
"Intuitive, insightful & aids inrecognizi"
Love it so far and it's accurate so far
"Tracks my sleep too, amazing"
"Sometimes is very on point, other times.... not so much."
It's been real. ;)
Seems to work well.
Totally Accurate 100%
This is amazing!
Very accurate! ‚ò∫
Great App!
Trumptastic
It's a gd app it's on point.
Self explanatory
This is a great app
What's the purpose? Waste of time.
Accurate Most of the Time
Interesting tech
Works Very Well
Dead on.
"This app does an excellent job of telling me how I sound on calls. It's been correct everytime. The sleep part not so good that's why 3 stars. I already wear a UP3 Band that monitors sleep too bad this app can't connect it'd be perfect. It says I sleep longer than I really do. Well thought out, the true age test is interesting."
Does not detect calls. Only detected 2. The calls are longer than 30 minutes and I'm connected to WiFi.
"This app is awesome. It has been accurate every single time I use it, except for the sleeping cycle portion. It often has me sleeping longer than I actually did. Maybe because I am alone and silent. Idk..."
I have had 2 new calls and neither one has resistered. Dissapointed that it stopped working.
I thought it would be correct some of the time but it is correct most of the time. Can't figure out how to use the sleep program. Really like the app.
When I first downloaded there was some major issues of it working but in less than 24 hours it was fixed. Because of that issue I cannot give 5 stars but like everything else in life it can get better
"I love the app but I cannot delete the history or the number, Now my wife think I'm cheating on her because it didn't let me delete the friend name I want. Please make change for the next update thank you"
Not always what I'm thinking or communicating but over time I believe it will help control my stress. I appreciate the stress helps
"This app truly captures my mood, my thoughts and even my intentions. I've been recommending this app to all of my family and friends. It's so accurate it's scary."
This is actually pretty spot on. Apparently I am super stress.
"I am enjoying this app, because it's keeps me mindful of my conversation with others. Out of a 100%, it has been 80% correct on evaluating my conversation and my sleep patterns."
It only detected 3 out of 7 phone calls
I have used this app on over 1 1/2 hours of calls. It isn't even close to accurate. A total waste of time! Time to uninstall this useless app.
This app has so far nailed every conversation I've had. Makes me realize how I respond to situations and which make me feel best /most stressed. Fascinating!
"My sister loves this app so I am trying to sign up, it just keeps telling me something went wrong."
I cannot believe that just by listening to my voice that this can pinpoint exactly how I've been feeling it's so amazing I love it
"Amazing, what a great app! It's an awesome & fun tool that can help you manage stress!"
Cant even sign in. Also can't reset password on the website.
Amazing and I would love to sponsor this app. Its helping so much hahaha I'm like relying on it haha
Good app. Helping me to understand what my feeling of stress is coming from! Thanks
"Unbelievably accurate, and very helpful insight into how my conversations are handled."
I don't normally leave lots of feedback but this app is dead on. It does exactly what it says... and does it well. Great job on this new and intuitive app.
Love this app. I am learning a lot about how I come across over the phone.
The Best This is really one of the best app I ever see its very helpful
So far so good everything has been on point
Five Stars
Really helps you to analyze your relationships!!!
Well designed Easy to use and full of useful information.
It's crazy how accurate this app is.
For the most part this app is accurate
Recommend it Everyone needs this app very helpful...Thanks y'all very much.
I'm amazed how accurate it is.
"Very accurate, definitely more self aware"
Love this app and it will help you control you self.
"Pretty cool... Design is clean and intuitive, smart and easy to use."
Pretty right on. Great food for thought.
Strong app This is a great app with awesome capabilities.
I'm trying to stay calm now ... I stress alotttt
It's o.k. I guess.
It's spot on.
Me
Awesome app
Insightful
Point on
Installed after seeing on Dr. Oz. No problem so far. Tried a phone call and it detected I was uneasy which was spot on. I will come back over a few days of evaluation and add a star if it appears to be accurate and keeps working. UPDATE: Only worked Once yesterday and not since. Keeps saying unable to load data. Tried to contact support this morning but no Response
"It rated my automated DTMF-tone website logon sequences as voice calls (note: there was no voice conversation on the line). Also rated (inaccurately) voicemail messages left and picked up. A 15 second, jocular, \""Can I call you back?\"" with a good friend was rated as \""intense\"" and \""irritated.\"" I don't know what parameters they used to program this app, but it's not ready for prime time yet: it was either completely or mostly inaccurate on all calls. Uninstalled. HTC M8."
"It's so accurate that it's almost eerie! I mean, how can a computerized program have such insight? But it certainly does! And I can use the objectivity to check myself and realize what I could be projecting that I don't want to. All my calls are in the green \""productive\"" zone so far at 15 calls. But it even picks up on those times when I may be uneasy with a subject or feeling like I'm walking on eggshells -- when it says I'm apparently doing pretty well at projecting calm and in control."
"I actually enjoy this amazing app it's spot on and helps you change your tone when you see the name on the caller ID, wondering.... if you can stay in the Green.‚òë"
"It was working last night, used it on one call. Today it's not working, saying I'm not connected to internet but I am because everything else on my phone works! I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app, I've reset my password, nothing works!!! Please fix this, a lot of people want to use this helpful app but it can't help us unless the app itself works! The problem is within the app not with the users or their phones!"
"I have registered, reset password several times, followed your help instructions and its just a continuous loop. Also online it will not allow me to accept terms."
First call worked. And pretty accurate. Second call didn't work and it was long enough. App says unable to load data. We'll see if it works later or not. It didn't. I reinstalled it and still can't load data. Uninstalling. Sorry. Kind of a pain.
"After several attempts, not allowed to register. Different messages every time."
"Straightforward & Functional Simple design, easy to use. One of the better free apps.Very well developed and does what I need."
I love seeing the direct feedback on how stressed my calls are! Sorry mom!
"But it won't let me sign up. Keeps telling me the pw should be 8 characters, but any pw I tried wouldn't work. After reading reviews, seems I'm not the only one and it's a problem with he app. Too bad, I was VERY excited to try."
It's already told me things about myself I didn't know. I can already see how I want all parts of my life to get out of red and into the green.
I have got to know their mindset when they're talking to me! Very interesting just after a few calls.
I could be having an argument with someone on the phone and it'll detect I was calm and balanced..
"Great app Just the right app I'm looking for.Useful and Simple exactly as the description says, simple app!!"
"does it not recognize long phone calls? 1 yesterday and 1 today..neither show up, i was connected to my WiFi.. Other than that i find it interesting"
Simple and easy Easy-to-use I love it! It's easy and straight forward. Nothing complicated about it.Very good app.
Awesome It is easy to use and more friendly than others.Good job.
"Signed up, got \""No internet connection: Retry or Logout\"". I tried both options. Then I read other reviews, and tried the managers suggestion to click on Forgot Password. I reset the password. Same error. I turned off Wifi and turned on my 4G. I surfed the internet.. It works. The app doesn't. So much for stress relief. I'm late for work!"
Not Accurate At All. Uninstalling
I need an app to tell me when someone's voice is stressed or yelling? That's what ears are for. What a waste!
"Good job!.. So far so good, thank you for bringing this to us.This is the best app i'v seen so far!"
I have found something where I know my tone
5 Stars It's worth more than 5 stars! A must have app...great job!!
What is going on with this app?? Where is this SLEEP feature? What is this app REALLY supposed to do? It only analyzed 3 calls on first day I downloaded and hasn't worked since. Moto E
This will help me at work!
Stopped working after only two calls.
"Forgot to make note of the password. Will I need it? If so, how do I fix it?"
Please fix!!
For
"Why is it that you care about our privacy that you will not share rent etc, to anybody without our written consent but will for a sale of our information."
Can't register
During the signup process it ask personal information: birth date gender zipcode. Why is this needed? I am concerned where this information goes. They cannot be left blank.
"I cannot enter in a password. It keeps telling me they don't match no matter what. - - - - - it worked, I registered online with my computer and then logged into my app on the phone. Thank you"
"It does not have a function to enable \""detecting\"" in person conversations face to face. In any case its like horoscopes once you read the result its more confirmation bias than science."
"I registered & made several lengthy calls and yet it states that there are No Calls to analyze. Ive ck'd the settings, everything seems fine. Very frustrating. I thought this would be a useful app but it doesnt even acknowledge when Ive made a call."
Tried multiple times. Unable to get passed sign up page..get error message stating that it cannot connect to server.
I'm trying to register for myself and using my wife e-mail she is already registered earlier today.. won't let me in.will try again
I would give it 5 starts .but when I get to the password on the regster part and I make it 8 letters and go to control it it's say not working help
My wife got it on her Samsung S4 and it worked. I dl it on my HTC M8 and it don't work. 45 sec call.
I fill out the questions to sign up and it gives me a pop up message saying there was an error communicating with the server. Can't even try the app out..
"Like the other reviews, nice idea but won't connect..so I uninstalled"
I saw on dr oz show and i tried to open it but i keep getting error.üò°
"Tells me error communicating, tried reinstalling and still can't register. My data is fine and service."
"Great application. The call feedback is very accurate. Amazing how it can pick up on my stress, even when I think I am trying to appear not stressed."
I'm sure everyone is having problems with it because is its crashed from the amount of traffic. I was able to get it and sign up no problem.
Tried to sign up and it says it can't connect to server.
I think that everyone is trying all at the same time so I will give it a couple of days and try to register again. I'm getting the same error message also.
Looks like it could be useful but needs to get fixed.
I tried several times to sign in and it would not accept my password.
Not letting me get pass set up. Says communication error
I was actually amazed at how accurate this app has been. One of the cooler health apps out there.
It keeps telling me that an error with server....
It doesn't allow me to sign up. All I see is error retry..error retry..
Need fixing unable to sign up
I can't get past the sign up page. Says there were problems connecting. Whatever that means.....
I'm not able to do this
Can't register keeps saying error system
Unable to sign up.
Can't create password and log in. Will try again later
Why can't I use this app with WIFI
Will not let me sign up
Not letting me sign up when I am filling everything out right and I am definitely connected to the internet also so there should be no problem but there is
Doesn't sign you in once you create an account...
I have been trying to sign up since Dr Oz show and I keep getting an error msg saying unable to connect to server please fix
Not able to sign up. Wasted MY TIME!!! Crappy.
Stops at sign on
Helps me deal with people. I use the rating to bring me to relaxed when I talk to customers.
Not tracking calls AT ALL. Therefore...Pretty useless.üòØ
Anyone wanna send me an invite please?
Calm
Love this app wish i had it a long time ago lets u know who u might not wanna deal with lol
"But I just called someone today, yet it didn't give me an analysis of the call.. not sure if I'm doing something wrong."
"And it's free...(right now). This app gives \""almost\"" real time analysis, in detail. Very GOOD! Helps you recognize your own vocal flaws & \""malfunctions\"". (Or talents)"
Monitors stress in your voice
Improving on my communication with others is always a plus. I really dig this app.
I forgot it and it did the same to me.
"After I type all of my information in and click the submit button, it kicks me out and sends me back to my home screen. What the hell? My stress level is totally off the scale right now!!!!!"
Housewife and Mother
I love that it gives instant feedback.
Like the app.
Cool idea for a app...
New beginning
Love
Health. Care
Works eerily well
I love the notification that occurs after a call is completed. It provides instant feedback when the conversation is still fresh. This app if making me more aware of how I'm perceived by the people I talk to. It is helping me modify my relationships.
"I tried 3 different addresses gmail, outlook , hotmail. Keeps saying invalid email address"
I have been trying to get logged on but it just sucks hard. I'm so pist I have deleted it.
This app makes me want to call people more just to see the analysis I would get. Definitely an eye opener and a chance to reflect on particular interactions with people.
This is a killer app if there ever was one .You must try it to understand it. An absolute must have !
Wont let me sign up says my email is invalid
CALMING
"How about the fact that this app is accessing the microphone on my device and monitoring my phone calls, had this for less than 24 hours but no thanks. Like hell do I want an app that is accessing the Mic in the background. It tripped the security on my phone and that is the only reason I knew it was accessing the Mic even when I wasn't on a phone call, it also didn't inform it was going to be listening in on phone calls and \""analyzing\"" then for stress."
Terrible. LISTENS to your calls. Requires daily data entry. Who tests there blood sugar AND cholesterol EVERY day. Dr Oz pushed this app so hard on TV. I've never watched his show and clearly I won't be ever again since I can't trust his judgment about a simple phone app.
"Really, this is by far the most useless app ever developed. I installed it and really tried hard to use it for 2 weeks, but it is so confusing and so worthless that it is not worth it. It is taking up space on my phone and is simply an advertisement for dr. Oz. It really made it so I will no longer watch dr. Oz. Or believe a word he says."
Multiple attempts to sign up. It's crazy. This app doesn't work. Shame on Dr. OZ. I knew it caused me stress. Same complaint says my email or password is wrong. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS APP! Don't tell me to contact your e mail address. Look at the number of similar complaints. Fix your app!
"Sign up,\"" \""sign in?\"" I have more than enough places that has my name in cyberspace. No thanks. One of the things I learned in the Army was how to talk on the telephone because you never knew when the person on the other end was an officer. As a truck driver I have to talk with customers and you can attract more flies with honey than you can with vinegar. Not sounding stressed in stressful situations can be an asset."
"Well, for starters, the multiple choice answers provided for the \""Let's get started\"" questions do not include the option box that states \""None of the above!\"" Therefore, I am skeptical of the integrity this App has when it comes to trusting any advice given to the subject/patient/customer, to be accurate when based on inadequate answers provided to choose to answer from! Sheesh!"
"I've been using this app for a month now and I have to say it's remarkably accurate in assessing my state of mind. It doesn't just measure the stress in my voice but attempts to understand and report back my own underlying intent from a conversation -- and it really works. Case in point: I did a phone call with a new work colleague and the app said my conversation was driven by \""Engagement, getting on the same page, personal connection...You seem to be trying to explain what to expect...\"" Wow. That analysis is 100% correct. Calls to family and friends have yielded similarly accurate results. Furthermore, I am learning how my own perceptions or \""muscle memory\"" has been coloring how I interact in my existing relationships. As a general enthusiast of pop psychology I find this app an incredibly useful tool. We all know from personal experience how hard personal change is. We tend to think of ourselves as hardwired, but science has shown this not to be true. But to rewire you need the insights to drive that change...and this app is helping me do that. Highest marks."
"Health and Wellness for lack of anything more original but so much more..Need some motivation? It's right here along with Doctors personalized to your needs, and alternative methods of natural ways to \""reverse\"" some of the \""hard knocks\"" life and just plain genetics, living, working, playing, and sometimes needing a little or a whole bunch of attention you'll VB never get 10 years w/ your internist. These folks see, \""the whole you\"" and put you on a path of. helping you do what you can to get back \""You."
"I like the concept and I like the analysis I got on a couple of calls. But then it won't update. It happened once for like a week, then worked for one day again and now has been over two weeks since it worked. Finally uninstalled simply because I'm tired of checking it for nothing."
"This app is required by my insurance company to earn incentive credits (extra money in my account). I now know why they chose this app. It is almost impossible to earn green days without being dishonest or already in peak condition. This app is an easy way for them to save money since most people cannot honestly earn green days. The automatic stress monitor is a joke, the sleep monitor is inaccurate, and the automatic step monitor does not work at all. After several weeks of trying to get the medicine tracker to work, I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. The medicine tracker seems to be working. My stress levels are fine until I have to deal with this app every day. Now, I will go run 2 miles without taking a single step (according to this app)."
"This app sounded really interesting. The problem was that it started out monitoring the first 4 calls I had. Then it stopped. In one call, I didn't even get to speak to a person. And it said I was productive. I can't understand how or why. I think this must be a gimmick. (My opinion )"
Horrible app. Actually listens to tour phone calls and rates them for stress and tells you what you were doing. Totally invasive. BEWARE
"I downloaded this app simply to receive additional insurance related benefits from my employer. This app feels extremely invasive. Within the first day, I turned off several of the features, including the one that rates your stress level based on phone calls. A recent update to my phone notifies me when an app tries to access my microphone, camera, etc. My phone has only notified me about Sharecare, which has accessed my microphone nearly 500 times in a 24 hour period. The app is now no longer on my phone, and I'm here writing a negative review for an app that was supposed to earn me easy extra money."
"Bugs out a lot. Doesn't track anything. When you try to go to your health profile it crashes, when you try to put medication you take it crashes."
Not even close on my mood during phone calls and way off on the number of steps I took (I'm in a wheelchair). Uninstalled after one day.
Had app installed on my phone 30 mins..removed it because my phone was very Hot. App seems to use alot of function on the phone causing it to be always running... the concept of the app seemed interesting though.
"Same with me,I just watched Dr.Oz and I'm having trouble so I uninstalled this app. So Sorry"
Most everyone complained same why you don't fix
"The app is extremely intrusive! Using the microphone to listen to and evaluate the stress levels of phone calls is a bit too much. No thanks, I'll just log my wellness activities on a computer."
Always said I was uncomfortable. Could not have been further from the truth. And my sleep time was way off.
This is number one app which consumes lot of battery I my Note5 with anroid 6. I may come back if come to know this app is optimized.
Quiet easy to download. This app makes me to stop and think in stead of giving a knee jerk reaction.
The app is great with making you aware of your overall health BUT the recording of calls turns me off. I was not made aware of this feature upon installation.
"I downloaded the app after watching Dr. Oz and said \""unable to create account, credentials already exist\"".. deleted after trying a few times.."
I've been trying for 5 days to install and it still won't download. Very disappointing
Saw it on the show. Didn't expect to see how stressed out I'm on my calls. Wish I'd had this sooner
"This app would not let me register it. I got messages that something went wrong, or that I needed to sign in but when I tried to do that I was redirected back to registering. Which it would not allow me to do. I uninstalled it from my cell, for a second time since I tried it again with the same results. I wont try again."
"Total battery killer. Never really got to use app, all it did was drain my battery fast. Uninstalled and battery life back to normal."
Useless and a waste of time app I wouldn't waste my time again even if it was the best app out there
"I've tried download this app to my new Android and signing in with a new account, it tells me I already have an account very weird cause I'm not a HMSA mmbr.. my first time on the app.. so I try to sign in and hit \""forgot my password?\"", and it won't send a code to create a new password. It's so irritating.. ughhh!!"
"When I tried to create an account, it said \""an account with these credentials already exists.\"" I tried again & it did the same thing."
"Once in a while, the analysis is a little bit off, but not by far."
"Rubbish, asked to confirm the country that I live, Brazil, after confirming states the msg something went wrong"
"Most calls show I'm impatient, tend to talk over people"
"Dwnld app, entered all required info, every time i click done (registering) it pops up a notice saying your users and Dr. Oz users should log in and gives the option to cancel or retry! No matter wich one i select it kicks me back to the sign up/register screen w/ the password highlighted saying they must be 8 characters! I tried several 8 character password and none take....kicks me right back to the message about your users and Dr. Oz users! Please help!"
Really cool tool to have with me every day. Gives me amazingly spot on results for my calls
Please help me remove this creepy app
"This app is very invasive of personal things, i.e. \""listens in on phone calls\"", uses the microphone I'm assuming to listen in on activity, etc. Made me feel very uncomfortable with the invasive nature of the app."
This app just makes me more stressed. Constantly tells you that that you are tense and irritated.
Not reliable. Voice interpretation is incorrect. Number hours recorded sleep is incorrect.
Requires a lot of input. Doesn't always do the auto record. Love the stress feature.
"I liked what it does, but I could not use my speakerphone with it. Had to uninstall"
I filled everything out correctly but every time I hit login it would tell me something went wrong. I think my stress level was raised a tiny bit but uninstalling it took care of that nicely. :)
Found out about this app on Dr oz and must say it works great Dr oz highly recommended this app give it a try you won't be disappointed
It monitors your phone calls. Had a message pop up after a call that said I sounded stressed. I removed the app immediately afterwards because I don't want big brother listening in.
Every day I have to resubmit my account or password definitely irritating and stressful
I am 65 years young. I could not record my accurate age
"I really love this app. It's so fun and I love all the studies. I only have 2 suggestions : I would really like to be able to see my steps through out the day besides waiting until the next day! And the second is the sleeping. I have a 6 month old and I have been up with her every hour to 2 hours so it doesn't really get my full waking and sleeping. I think it would be neat if we could manually put in when we wake each time. Overall it's great , fun and easy to use :)"
"This is creepy & it's an invasion of privacy! It knows what time I go to bed & wake up & it knows all of my phone conversations & what mood I'm in! I'm complaining to HR, we shouldn't have to do this for insurance incentive points!"
Won't let me register. Keeps telling me to try again.
Won't let me in or sign up.
"While this had some good features, the fact it was by far the most battery usage on my phone made me remove it. And... who really wants software to grade your conversations on the phone...?"
Could not get logged in so can't try this app:(
It would not even let me sign up. It kept telling me that other users of Dr Oz had to be logged in also. What's up with that crap? I would not have given you a one if I didn't have to.
It will not allow me to sign in.Says Password retry.WRONG!
Couldn't even set up a account to log in
"This app listens to your phone conversations and then give you an analysis of how \""anxious\"", \""uneasy\"", \""impatient\"", etc you sound. Creepiest app ever!"
This app seems very invasive of my privacy. It heard my phone conversations and knew when I went to bed. What next? Made me very uneasy. Will no longer participate.
Doesn't let me sign up!
This app is good but requiring new users to provide health insurance or employer information is NOT. Why do you need that information? So you can share our health habits with them for $?
Won't sign me up.
It is not letting me sign in.
Connecting error
Too much unrelated junk in this app.
Unable to sign up after installed.
I found the phone call moods extremely inaccurate. I had a conversation where I was laughing and having a great time. But it thought I was frustrated and annoyed??????
Helps me be more mindful and self aware.
Google it best app yet
It's ok for a free app
Didn't like it monitoring my calls
Everything okay
Is a life saver
It's a pretty cool app everyone to try it
"Tried several passwords that meet app password rules, no joy, removed app."
Saw dr. Oz so i downloaded the app
Won't let me log in
Downloaded but said already have an account.
I love it. Keeps me more focused
This is terrible. ..
It wouldn't even let me sign up
Could not let me sign up I keep reentering my password
"will not allow to create an account, states that I have account alreadyüòë"
Won't Let Me Download. Just Saw It On Dr.Oz üò° #SaysWaitingForNetwork üòî
I Hope This Helps Me Out!!! AMEN
For stress
This is not accurate at all
An informative app.
I Love Love Love this app!!!
great app.
Very informative.
What stress?üòÑ try share care
"Farsical. A code, even knowing my account and password? Goodbye. I'll allow others to profit by advertising"
It is the best
Its very interesting
Intense
fabulous app
excellent
AWESOME
I signed up to get this and I've been waiting two days to get that supposed confirmation email that I never got. And it's NOT going to arrive so I Deleted this. It's Not Worth it!
Like it.

It's a very good tool to help me balance my life
"This app cannot tie to my samsung watch. It was before but now its not anymore. The app crashes all the time and the notification bell is always showing my I have something new, but I don't. Very frustrating to make sure I have the app for work, but cannot tie to my watch to make sure my walks count instead of manually logging in. It's just a pain."
Extremely glitchy. It doesn't keep you logged in so you'll constantly have to re-sign in and update all your steps If it logs out in the middle of the day it won't record those steps if you're using it for automatic tracking. As of right now it hasn't worked for two weeks. the app won't even open it just sits on the opening page.
"I hate this app. I go to the gym 20+ times a month and now have to waste my life notifying my insurance company through this app to get any credit for being healthy. This is just a way for insurance companies to avoid paying out $20/month. This app and their website are also very buggy, and sometimes never load. I assume it's intentional, as less money is reimbursed if people don't use Sharecare."
"2 days in & going to dump this app. Encouraged by Blue Cross/Blue Shield to use this for a monthly $20 reward (rebate?) if kept up activity & fitness based on Sharecare's \""green\"" zone 21+ days/mo. I don't use a FitBit/similar to track my activity; just app on my android which I thought this might replace. Even though it tracks location had to manually enter steps from other app as well as other measurements. Easy to cheat if your goal is the reward. Or if you don't already chart your numbers."
"I'm supposed to get Walmart discounts but each time I try, I have to fill out a really long survey and then no discount. There was also a scam for \""coupons\"" attached. What a piece of junk. Don't use!!! Zero stars."
"Seems phishy Idk why so much information was needed just justify my \""real age\"" very suspicious."
"After several updates, app works as if using website."
I like this app as it is how my health insurance does reimbursement instead of gym check-ins. The app is able to sync with my Fitbit app and automatically track my steps that way but on occasion it doesn't work quite right.
a wonderful app to get educated and learn healthy habits
"App was great for years and I logged into it daily with no issue. Recently, I am lucky if I can open it every other day. I'm told I have no internet connection (inaccurate) and even logging out/back in doesn't resolve the issue. I have even tried uninstalling/re-installing several times with no success. I count on this app to maximize my HRA benefits, but lately, it's worthless because it won't open! Easy when it works, just wish it did so more frequently."
"Love the company, the app & the amazing services, content and information to access and explore! The app is easy to use, aesthetically pleasing and just an essential part of my ongoing health and wellness journey!"
Hate it
"I love the rewards from this app for keeping active! We've been using for 2 years! I went to redeem the reward today, but when I hit redeem it sends it back to the home screen instead of the rewards page."
"Not only does it freeze up when trying to use, customer service is extremely slow. I've been trying to find resolution to an issue for nearly 6 months."
‚ù§
App keeps crashing when I scroll through benefits. And I don't see my vision coverage.
Hate how it never syncs & you have dig to put steps in manually.
I was excited to use app and complete the real age test. It would never allow me to get past the selfish.
Seems like it could be a good app but it isn't tracking my steps or sleep from my fitbit. I tried syncing it with Google fit before my fitbit & that didn't work either. I also can't seem to edit previous days.
"It worked fine but, now it closes every time I try to enter my daily information. I have to open it several times to get it to work now."
Lots of glitches. Can't get the Real Age Challenge to work. Trying uninstalling and reinstalling.
Buggy since recent update
This has been a good way to keep me accountable.
Great
Love this app. Helps me to stay on top of everything health related
"Easy, convenience, and accuracy."
"I like the app, but sometimes have problems with the tracking. A new thing I found might be a bug is the healthy interactions tracking with family, friends and others. It has three levels and gives faces. I noticed that when I say I have lots of healthy interactions the face is actually sad when I would think it should be happy; odd; I didn't like all the sad faces so I changed my response to the middle response Maybe an update would fix that. Seeing a sad face was not positive reinforcement."
"No integration with Garmin watches/Connect. This is really needed. (And if I use Google Fit to track steps to this app, I cannot edit to compensate for Garmin steps). Cannot hide items to track or pick favorites to always show first."
Very useful app. Pm use friendly and popoulated with a variety of helpful tips and resources to improve and maintain good health. Always fall back to the app when I am less self-motivated
"Lots of good information, challenges, without being annoyingly invasive like other apps and programs. Love the rewards and upbeat motivation! Lots of healthy resources."
None of my rewards are showing to get the discount on my insurance.
This app is very helpful with encouraging me to be healthier overall
Generally positive
"I generally enjoy the app, but some times the videos don't run. They will get stuck, and I have to skip half or more to get to a point where it will continue. Sometimes data from my fitness tracker come across completely wrong, but it's been better lately. I don't like that the challenges seem to end Eastern time. My data for the last day of the challenge is usually incomplete."
"I have now scheduled 3 coaching appts. The first two didn't happen bc somehow sharecare dreged up a ph # I haven't used in ten years (and was not used in recent years with other provider). Today, no call with correct #. That wouldn't be so horrible except they say they have an hr 2 call you, so I waited an entire hour... for the THIRD time. A DR wouldn't make you wait an hr. A call might run over, but not more than 15 minutes. Also, did webinar no credit, so I spent more time fixing that."
"Needs a lot of work. Especially in the import of info from trackers. I can input sleep details, but not steps. In my profile, I registered that I don't drink alcohol or smoke. Everyday it asks how many drinks I've had and if I've smoked. It asks daily for latest cholesterol. I don't know anyone that checks that daily. BP of 105/58 is flagged as high?! There's more, but not enough space to detail all here."
Please add a garmin connector. Manually adding steps each day is not worth it
"Major bugs that need to be worked out!! First, it defaults to Spanish (all countries listed are in Spanish). Second, on my Android phone, when entering my birthdate it displays Jan 1980. I would have to scroll back through EVERY month until I get to my birthyear of 1966. Not gonna happen."
Horrible app performance. It stopped tracking steps with my Samsung Health integration abruptly after working for months. Now it will not even open.
Keep kicking me off
"This app works marginally. It is supposed to track your steps and go get points/earn money for exercise. The problem is the app breaks almost every day, doesn't track well at all, logs you out constantly. It's like a no risk trial. You sign up but then it almost seems designed to make you fail at earning what you did. This app CAUSES me a lot of stress, which it also says to try to decrease. Please, just fix it."
"Great for logging all my goals AND keeps me on track for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Additionally, I love the challenges and the all in one health aspect."
"Doesn't work. It keeps trying to make me download the Wellness app. Then when I do, it logs me out of sharecare. Then asks me to verify my phone number. Then when I click on the scaleback program it kicks me out of wellness and back to the sharecare app, where I have to verify my phone number AGAIN. It's a cyclical error and I get nowhere."
Positive - it's very comprehensive with a lot of features Negatives - it's intrusive; not terribly intuitive to use; autosynch works poorly
"Too automated, won't take you to information requested"
Won't load the app stays on Green screen with logo.
Not very intuitive
The sharecare app is amazing
I installed the update and now the app sits and spins on the opening green screen. Really disappointing.
Doesn't automatically track steps anymore
The only reason I have this app is to get the $20/month insurance rebate. The app is pretty useless when compared to most any other similar app. Samsung Health which was pre-installed on my phone is MUCH easier to navigate and doesn't crash or just stop working all the time like Sharecare does. It's honestly getting really close to the point where I'd rather just not deal with the nuisance of this app and lose out my monthly rebate. Their 3.3 average across 3000+ reviews should be a hint.
I have been unable to open the app on my Google pixel for somwte now. I will delete and reinstall and see if that makes a difference.
S√≥ good üòä
Customer care is not 24/7.. When you do manage to reach them they are rude and not helpful. The site asks for way too much personal information.
It won't work with fitbit. Shows that it is tracking but have to put in steps manually each night. Customer service just says uninstall and install again but still not tracking. Used to work fine but newer version not good.
Very good
"I strongly disagree with one of the rating scales included in this app: Relationships. This app is biased against introverted people. Having \""many\"" interactions everyday is a horrible experience for me, as an extremely introverted person. It creates all the other negatives: stress, high blood pressure, etc. That's the one that should be the red unhappy face, and the \""no interactions\"" is a happy green face for me. It also doesn't detect my sleep at all, even though it says auto-tracking is on."
My work just switched to this Sharecare and the app crashes 100% of the time on any option I hope to explore. It does seem like it could be useful but again crashes with every tap. Can't use it at all.
This App is impossible!!!!! I have wasted hours on the phone and computer. I give up!
Yay
Thank you
Be more active!
"I disconnected my Samsung Health app from sharing information and don't plan to utilize the Sharecare app anymore. I was encouraged to use it by my employer but after days of having to manually enter my sleep times, steps, etc. it's become another task in my daily activities and I don't need another task to remember. It makes me manually enter my sleep time and also my steps even though it says it should be able to obtain those. Then sent me info to walk more even though Samsung had me at 11000."
"Worthless app that my company requires us to use as part of our health insurance. Says it will connect with samsung health so that you can sync activity so that you will not have to manually enter it but samsung health is not listed as an option to sync with. Also no options on app or Web for customer support to get help. I can't spent half my day on this app entering steps, food, sleep activity etc."
"The app, like the entire Sharecare program, is needlessly convoluted, tedious, and gamified, all with the intent to save for-profit insurance companies money by dangling the possibility of a Visa gift card in front of participants. Stop infantilizing us. Stop treating healthcare like we're in kindergarten, like if we behave we get a pizza party. To the person not getting paid enough to respond to this, don't bother writing back with a generic response about \""working together."
Neat way to track your health.
excellent. ....love all the different programs and information
The AP has good intentions but doesn't perform 60% of the time. There's always some sort of error
Useless and a waste of time.
"You have to manually update your steps every day. It's TERRIBLE at synching...as long as you do that, it's pretty sweet to get $20 a month!"
Poor setup
"The Clear Cost, find a provider feature through both the Sharecare app and website are not working. This issue has persisted for over a month. Trying to use the feature presents an error saying the service is unavailable. Contacting support, they were unable to resolve the issue, and escalated the issue to their internal engineering team, or similar. Weeks later, and I have not heard anything back and the error still occurs. Don't use this."
I love being able to talk to other that trying to get a healthy life style and getting support from the coach and members
Very difficult to use
It seems like something new breaks with every update.
I am unable to log in on my Samsung Galaxy Fold 3.
"Can't even log in now, just gives a green screen. Missed days to track during a challenge because of this and even though they say you can submit up to 7 days of prior entries, there is nowhere to do that. So what's the point?"
"Be really careful with this app, I noticed that my microphone was being activated and when I looked at the apps using it, Sharecare was opening the microphone constantly. Also it had access to even my files. Uninstall this things as soon as you can"
"I mainly was interested in the \""real age\"" part of the app. Too bad old school BMI is still used. I am 188 lbs at 7 percent body fat and I am considered overweight üòÇ"
No way in hell I'm giving an app that much access to my device
Good app but has a bit of a battery drain issue about 10-15% a hour. Considering the app needs to be logged in for step tracking that logging out bit doesn't make sense.
"Unable to use for months, leaving insurance company because of it."
"Dear Sharecare. Please create a reddit page. 1) I use reddit as a way to troubleshoot issues I have with devices/apps based upon the solutions of other people 2) To figure out how good a product is and to compare it to competitors. 3) To share my experiences with a product so others can benefit. 4) I personally do not have twitter or use facebook often. My favourite site to learn about products is reddit. (You want the best nutritional supplements, go to reddit and see what the people say.) 5) Many companies have reddit pages. r/fitbit has 79,00 members, etc... 6)basically I like seeing 100's of anecdotes on a product. Thankyou, no real issues besides that just getting started with the app so my five start is premature."
MASSIVE DATA USAGE - This app used 11GB of data in one month. That's criminal!
All in one health solutions!
I appreciate the holistic approach to my well-being that this app encourages. The resources available are extremely helpful!
Does not sync correctly with Google fit. The number of steps are always randomly off. It's the only reason for me to have the app.
For the most part I like the app. Except my wife and I keep getting logged out. And than it drains my battery until I log back in.
Very good experience. Easy to use app.
Love this app
"Very poor system,"
I filled out all of my personal info only to be told I had to contact their help center because they wouldn't allow me access to their site. When I tried to contact the help center that was not available either.. so are they just taking my personal information to use for God only knows what purposes? This appears to be a very untrustworthy company.
"unreliable, it will just stop working for no reason despite no changes. It was tracking steps but no longer will. useless app. Updated: this app has gotten even worse, now I cannot even manually enter my steps in the tracking section. The app continues to be unreliable and worthless. I would rate it negative 5 stars if possible. Update: still unreliable. Still won't track or sync with anything properly. This app is 0/10"
"Love this app, but since your update yesterday my entries are not saving correctly. Plus some of my entries are not showing up. Please fix again. Thank you"
The app has stopped working. Every time I try to open the app it closes. Can you please fix this problem.
"Has a lot of information, but there's so much that doesn't work in this app. I can't even schedule a coaching session with the app. I used Rally before my insurance changed and loved how the daily challenges tracked. Wish this app were more like that one."
Can't sign up because its giving me Estonia instead of the USA for my country. There is no USA on the list
Good
Easy to use
"It prompted me to update my up and when I tried, the inly option was to install it on additional devices which I don't have. It's ridiculous and I can no longer use the app."
Excellent
Very helpful app.
It takes a long time to actually get into the app.
"Overall, not bad. It does annoyingly it tells you have \""new results in your health profile\"" without giving an indication what updated even after opening the app."
Sometimes dont work
I got this because its what my health insurance uses. I connected it to my Fitbit; indicates its connected yet Sharecare isn't showing my steps so far.
"Like many others have said there are issues with auto tracking. It seems to track my steps, but does not apply them towards my works step challenge. You have to do that annually it appears. Autotracker also randomly turns off I guess, so keep an eye on that. These issues are probably why companies choose subpar apps - they don't have to pay the incentives. Also, there NEEDS to be a way to delete accounts! I don't see a way, but there is contact info for support..."
I enjoy using the app
Asks for a review every day all while being unintuitive and clunky to use. But hey at least they made it easy to review!
"My experience with this app has been terrible. I participated in the Move More Challenge for work to earn an incentive. I did the required number of steps each day and it has been showing up in the app. However, I didn't receive the incentive because the app claims an automatic tracker was not connected. Well then how did it automatically receive my steps?! Customer service was terrible. I was blamed for not contacting them when I had no idea there was a problem, which they refused to solve."
"Garbage app. I only use it to get my monthly insurance money. Tracking doesn't work with my watch as advertised, have to manually enter. Half the time it won't load and says \""no internet connection\"" despite having unbridled access to LTE and Wifi, happen s to my wife too so it's not just my phone. Manually adding your steps is cumbersome, and Dr Oz is a trash doctor selling snake oil, they should dump him, he is a disgrace to the medical community."
They won't take me off their list even after I told them to many times. They also sell your information.
doesn't sync to Google Fit even when it says it is syncing. some good articles.
Keeps shutting down. Won't even open.
"Good and very helpful with keeping up with goals. One annoying problem is that it never keeps track of my steps so will have to remember to always add them manually. The app tracks my sleep most of the time. But overall, it's OK."
Im fully satisfied!
"Tracking not working, activating a device takes you to a menu without the choice. Connecting via Google fit doesn't sync all steps."
"Absolutely horrible. Nothing but an app to track everything you do. When you do earn the damn \""rewards\"" it takes the money from your account but doesn't give you the \""reward\"". Total garbage."
It requires a code but it won't open. Reset the code 5 times.
"Wealth of information on mental and physical health issues. A good first \""go to\"" app that is very comprehensive."
"App will not allow me to login. Only shows 'Error communicating with server'. The network connection is working and my account works when connecting to the website. Not sure what is going on with the mobile app, but it is extremely poor. DO NOT RECOMMEND."
The app transfers gigabytes of data each month in the background and will use mobile data. The solution from the support team was to block network data access to the app and was unable to tell me what data was being transferred. At this point I am expecting the worse and assume this app is using a malicious library allowing others to proxy connections through my phone or is stealing my personal data. Uninstalled.
Nothing but issues since I discovered this program!!
"App is broken. If I'm able to log in, it's missing my information. Same with the website."
This app won't even install. So frustrating!
"Never tracks my steps via my Fitbit, terrible, non user friendly app."
"I used this for a month, had tracked an entire goals worth of data and suddenly it disappeared. I contacted customer support who requested I send them proof of my account and when I did they said they would fix it. That was about 2 & 1/2 months ago. They also messed me out of the money I earned through their age test. I will never use this app again."
Just.seems.too invasive to my privacy and very time-consuming just to get started in the many categories....Just didn't trust it or feel comfortable with it with my health info ...Uninstalled it.
Hard for me to navigate and frustrating. Maybe I will get more comfortable with it if I use it. I don't want all it offers I just wanted a membership card to join the gymüôÉüòä
"It's an ok app. It can't calculate other non- step activities, you have to do that manually. I also hate that it asks me every day, if I smoke, and I don't, and my cholesterol every other time, when they know you won't be going to your doctor all the time to check it."
App fails to sync properly with Fitbit after latest update
"After latest update, tracking does not work at all. Keep entering daily items but nothing is saved. Sharecare does not properly auto sync with Fitbit or Google Fit. Steps and sleep are wrong or not counted."
I was forced by my company to use this.
"Why would Samsung health be removed as an option for automatic tracking? I can't track my steps or my sleep now unless I manually input it, which discourages me to do it. Seriously, who has time to do that daily? Guess I won't be getting my incentives for participating towards my health insurance."
Awesome app
I love this app. It has helped me through a lot and the information on here is very helpful.
Crashes frequently.
Updated 5/11/23 and I can't get into the app. Frustrating. It worked perfectly fine and then it doesn't. What happened?
Great app and service
Downloafed it..registered but tells me credentials already done. Dont remember setting up before. Ok eent to update password....Doesnt like that idea... Gives Error in prcessing...there is not contact for assistance. Will uninstall horrible when you cant get any support to know why cant update password which happen to be long enough
Annoying. Doesn't update steps out sleep even though it says it is. Have to manually enter everything. Not use friendly.
"Love the app. However, it ate up all of my data and I had to uninstall it. Dont know why. I have been enjoying it for awhile. No problems until recently."
Step counter worked and then stopped. Uninstalled and reinstall twice. Same thing happened again.
Constantly can't log in. Get in infinite loop that goes nowhere. Very poor design.
Absolute trash. Crashes constantly in the background. Automatic tracking for steps NEVER works. It feels like the app was designed to ensure no one is able to achieve the monthly goals that gives you the $20 incentive for being healthy. Wife has the exact same experience (possibly worse) on an iPhone.
It is useful for what I need.
Works greatüëç
"App used to work great with my Fitbit, but now the steps are way off sync and much lower than the actual steps I get with my Fitbit. This is cumbersome because now I need to manually enter my steps each day for my rewards. Please resolve Sharecare"
Keeps crashing. Can't log anything for work
"I can't add my Samsung Health to the app, although it claims to be able to. The sole purpose of the app is to keep track of healthy habits and participate in healthy challenges. Other than this issue, I can input my daily activities myself, even though it is slightly inconvenient. App works as intended otherwise. Sometimes it does lag with the uploading of initial opening- though may have to close down the app a few times before it opens up."
"I love this app! I sights and articles are great. Coupl3d with the Samsung Health app on my phone, they give me a great overview of where I'm at and what I'd like my health goals to be. Since I've added Sharecare's Scale Back app, I'm having trouble getting the Sharecare app to load, sync or function. Hoping a reinstall might solve it. Would be 5 stars aside from that."
I love this app it really helps you stay in top of your health.
Last year my Samsung watch was connected and able to track my sleep and steps. Now I am unable to connect the two and my sleep and steps are not syncing it is a waste for me now cause I have to manually enter everything.
Fine
"Easy app to navigate and it tells you pretty much everything you need to know about the programs, activities and rewards. Gives you tips on how to live a much better and healthier lifestyle. And you can keep up with everything you have done towards the Share are Incentive program very easily."
Started back to working reason for failure was unknown
Overall this works ok. Some weird bugs in the tracking screen where you select the day. Also Garmin not syncing is a major omission. No one uses fitbit.
Just keeps crashing
"An ok interface for manual entry. 100% worthless as a tracker device app. I do not carry my phone to bed. I do not carry my phone most of the time while exercising i.e. on the treadmill. The app/software should link to garmin/fitbit/apple watches/fitness trackers. Even more usefull if it linked to the Garmin and fitbit sites or MyFitnessPal, Cronometer nutrition sites. Overall the app is a waste of phone space, just use the online website you get as much functionality and it is easier to read/navigate. Just got a form reply apologizing for NOT working. As far as I can find on the app there is no way to link devices to AUTOMATICALLY import information. Especially from Garmin Connect app or any of the Garmin devices that are linked to my Android phone already. Sending automatic, form emails is not helpful. Downgrading to a 1 star review."
Very cool stuff.
"PoS app logged me out again. Lost the last 10 days of steps. Google fit still has them all. Sync doesn't work. This is the worst app I've ever used. Edit: BS, I've contacted support. They just give excuses and provide ZERO remedies."
"App runs slow, app won't open at times. It no longer tracks my steps and has general glitches it used to not have. The last update needs to be looked into."
Needs to track events in an offline mode. I'm trying to participate in work wellness events but I can't if I'm out of cell tower range. Also an overwhelming interface. Too many steps and redundancy. Update: This app uses a ridiculous amount of data.
1 star because I can't give zero stars. The most frustrating and least functional app I have. Seems to only get worse with each update.
Useless. Stops tracking. Have to restart it constantly. Seems to be designed to insure you can't complete a challenge.
Update: IT'S FINALLY FIXED! I'm happy to report that Sharecare has finally fixed the issue with connecting to Samsung health and it seems to be working correctly! The most recent update did not include a fix to the Samsung health linking issue. The option to connect to Samsung health is gone. I can't track my steps correctly because I don't always carry my phone but always have my watch. This needs to be fixed.
Integration with Samsung Health broken. Step tracking does not grab all the steps. While troubleshooting it no longer connects to Samsung Health with oath error.
"Broken integration with Google Fit. This app will not connect with Google Fit. When attempting to connect I get an error message \""This app is blocked... This app attempted to access sensitive data in your Google account\"". Looking online it appears the app doesn't support required security infrastructure to link to Google. Please fix."
Do you enjoy being signed out spontaneously and then finding out it wasn't tracking your steps and then finding out customer service is more of a disaster than an American army pulling out of Afghanistan? Then do I have an app for you.
Can never open app. It immediately goes back to homescreen
"Most comprehensive health & wellness app I've ever used! I really like how the app guides the user to assess their \""RealAge\"" and then recommends personalized content and features to help focus on key areas of improvement. Sharecare also includes so many features to promote a healthier lifestyle such as: trackers, challenges, programs, a personalized health profile, and TONs of updated content to reference on related health topics. Highly recommend it!"
"I like the app, but I do not like it does not take my weight previously entered. Ot defaults tp 180lb. It should default to the last weight entered."
It asks you to choose your country - but the United States of America is not listed.
This app just used 7 gb of data in a day over my mobile and went over my plan limit!!!. It's also using significant wifi data. Unacceptable since this is part of my work health insurance requirements.
Care about what
I get to know about my health
Very difficult and confusing to use.
"Great concept, poor consistency. Last two days I set up app to teach steps,,, 0 steps recorded"
"The app just... stopped working. It won't open, it just sits there and stares at me üòµ‚Äçüí´"
"Was working fine for a couple weeks, now today it just glitches when I try to open it and it won't open. Will try to uninstall and install it again. We'll see."
Motivational. Very informative.
Excellent
Useful
ORIGINAL POST: The November 2019 upgrade made the app functionality worse. Just received a message from Sharecare saying you have to enter data on the same day - by midnight and you can no longer go back to edit your entries.
Cant sign in
Fine
Barely works at all. Constantly logging me out and can't log back in. Often never loads.
Worked fine until yesterday's update. Now it won't even open.
"App won't load and shuts itself down. If i can't log my weeks, what's the point??"
App used almost 4 GB of data in a single month. Next closest app used 400 mb. I had to start using the website instead.
This app is horrible to navigate. The usability is even worse. It's like a black hole of nothingness. Urgh!!
Never accurately syncs with FitBit. Sleep times also do not match (is there a time code setting). Also does not tie in with company email/participants effectively for team tracking...
I hate this app
"Forcing me to update the app instead of logging in, and tapping the update button does nothing. Great job!"
"There is absolutely no reason this should be using up 8gb of my data even on WiFi. I open the app once a week to log some manual things, thankfully don't need to for steps (anymore). I am deleting from phone and will manually add my steps to desktop."
Someone used my email to sign up for an account with you. I've been trying to contact you and nobody is responding so I had to download the app just to leave this review. I want my information deleted. I never gave permission for you to use it - it is stolen information. Delete my account and any associated information before I file a compaint with HHS.gov.
Redeemed points for Amazon GC and never received the redemption link. App is buggy and unreliable.
Aweful app. Picture links don't work. Search bar doesn't work. Content only fair. Very slow loading. Android S22.
"When I tried to claim my reward, the app kept closing. It actually kept closing a lot during the past couple of months."
"I always tht this was a great alternative to buying a Fitbit, but it became so unreliable and now the step tracker just quit entirely. Soooo disappointing, I had to change my review!"
"It keeps saying something went wrong when I'm trying to locate fitness locations. No matter what zip code I add, it does not work."
"Required for my employer healthcare. App uses a huge amount of mobile data. Had to get a firewall to block it. If I could, I would delete and forget this app."
Updated my app signed in says I need asbury community update plus you need a 6 diget code which doesnt come till after 10 minutes is up ...
Eats battery life. Had to uninstall. It's a great concept but the way it ate through my battery was unnerving. I am not a person that walks around with a charger because I have a Motorola. At noon my battery was at 50% from being fully charged.
Great information
Very well done!!
I updated it and now I'm locked out because it's asking for a code that it never sent to my phone!
Since the update i haven't been able to use the app. Tells me there's missing information from my insurance then some kind of server error.
No longer tracks my steps and i can't even manually enter my steps. I have to copy and paste to put in steps. I have emailed and no response. Typical insurance company. Suppose to many people are using it and getting the $20 and now they don't want to honor it. Today i can't even open the app. I only gave it one star because i couldn't get out with no stars.
"Had to install this for insurance purposes for work. The moment I sign in and click on my benefits, it immediately kicks the app closed. Not impressed at all. Please fix it"
"I have to have 3 apps for my watch to sync with this app. I have Garmin and neither this app, nor any of the ones that are supported will directly sync with Garmin connect. This is frustrating and irritates me that my employer requires the use of this app to gain health rewards. This is definitely feedback that I will provide to them."
Love the articles too.
App won't open after update
So far so good.
"Sometimes this app doesn't connect at all. In addition, it sends too many notifications that I can't clear, so I end up putting my phone on silent a lot."
Awesome!!
It was working. Now app will not open!
I don't like being forced to update the app.
Doesn't work. Error msg at log in. Uninstalled.
COMPLETE FRAUD
Dont have
The app is manageable as I navigate through...
"Can no longer sign in to app - says that my account needs updated. When I try to do that, I get a server error message. This, on top of all the other frustrations around data entry, is infuriating. There has to be a better way to access my benefits."
No 2022 challenges available?? Already lost 1 day to be able to track.
really made look at self health gives ideas to live longer and stronger
Very informative app. It keeps me in the health loop.
Good benefits and knowledge
This Dog Won't Hunt
"Loaded with trackers such Visual Studio App center that attempts to get information unrelated to the app such as phone type, screen resolution, unique Android indenifier and many more. Uninstalled."
Like it
Update: They fixed it in a timely manner. New rating is 5 instead of 1 The update before this current update has completely crashed the app. It continues to quit itself so you can't open the app or track anything. Also before this update it was not syncing with Samsung Health. It might sync 1 day out of 2 weeks. Which is sad because this app used to be great.
Great
"Would be a beneficial app if it worked without crashing. I don't think it's worked properly for the past month. When it does work, it seems to be pretty okay."
"I deleted this app from my phone and redownload. It worked great for 2 days and now the tracker has stopped working again. I may to quit using this app it's very frustrating, but it's connected to a fitness program where I work."
"Would not load. Had to delete and reinstall. None of my steps were counted towards the $20.00 per month reward. Even after the update won't show the step goal reward activity and I will obviously not be getting the 20.00 gift card for Oct, Nov and Dec even though I will hit the 20+ days."
Love the app very much good way to make points and gift cards when you have Care Plus
Will not save entries!!!
Uninstalled and reinstalled and the app works again
It does not match Google fit which it is supposed to get its data.
Navigation can be confusing when using the back button in Android
The format is great- easy to input and track data. But the app glitches way too much. It frequently gives an error message saying it is not connected to the internet (when the internet is actually connected) and locks me out of the app
Poorly maintained site.
"Set it up to automatically track steps but it never tracks right. For example my device will say 11,000 and the tracker on the app will say 1300. And I can't always update the tracker. The app also closes out often. I could go on..."
"Not earning ANY rewards for ANYTHING. Everyone @ my job is earning rewards such as Starbucks. I just sit there wishing & wondering. Probably going to end up deleting because at this point, it's only taking up space on my device."
I am enjoying this app and it has been amazing for Accountability and I love doing the challenges and earning points!!!! Looks like the update fixed my Red face issues for Relationships. My green faces for the week had turned to red unhappy. Just did the update and their back to normal!!!! üòä
Can't update so this is garbage!
Tracking steps sync is very inaccurate. Google Fit will show a much higher count than what is being recorded on the app. Been off over 6k steps in just a single day. This is since the March 14 update.
Helpful the best
"Trying to sign up, it will not give me the option to select United States as country."
"This site is garbage. If my job didn't require it, I wouldn't waste my time. The generic suggestions without knowing someone is off-putting. Before making assumptions of what someone should or shouldn't eat or do, it should ask questions if the person is already doing these things or if they have any food allergies or intolerances. It doesn't take into account what you have already been doing, it only looks at numbers you type in and acts as if you made no effort before this app existed."
"This app is ridiculously non intuitive and unreliable. When I finally figure out how to enter my tracking info (required by employer), sometimes it saves sometimes it does not. The longer I use this app, the more likely it will not save. Beyond frustrating."
The password change and complexity requirements make this unacceptably difficult to keep working. It forgets login info and is not worth the effort to save a few dollars.
Very user friendly
Tried to sign up. Just says that something is wrong.
This app is frustrating. I've tried three daily check in for the VSA challenge it does not work. I placed a ticket about this issue and never resolve. So far I'm supposed to receive $3.30. But nothing so far to resolve the issue. Just a waste of time.
It's ok
"App is junk, especially compared to other health app provided by employers previous health insurer."
"The app is okay. It is not intuitive. One has to really search to try to find information, and even then may not find it. I hear about an activity benefit ($20/month if reaching a steps goal). I am active, working out at the gym 3-5 times a week, then getting my steps, even if it is late, to reach 7,500. I have been doing this over 3 years. How much of the $20/month benefit have I received? $0. That means BCBS has kept $720 in this coffers. How many others is this happening to?"
Great tool for easy access health information!
Great!.. Very user friendly and love all of the healthy tips!
Poor layout. Doesn't connect with Google or Samsung for tracking. Outdated food recommendations.
Keeps losing access to my Fitbit app and doesn't sync with the web portal. Didn't have this issue a year ago.
"The app is fine when it works, but it's an absolute mess when it doesn't. The latest update has it spamming my notifications with the sleep detection notification, and the app closes itself immediately when I open it. Even before this, and given page or feature only had a 50:50 chance of working on any given day. Overall this app is super buggy and the developers need to do some better testing and make sure their servers stay up more than just every other day."
This app often goes haywire. It logs me out and won't accept my log-in information. I have to uninstall the app and reset the whole thing. Pain in the @ss!
"Numbers being tracked are way lower than the number on my fitbit. Used to work great! Updated my fitbit firmware, still not resolved. No update avail for Sharecare"
healthcare
Easy to use and educational
The automated tracking doesn't work most of the time. Now the app also drains my battery. Today 9h 8m of background use and 17% of battery usage. This app is so terrible my wife quit using it because she's tired of messing with it. I'm about sick of this as well. It is obvious by all of the bad reviews there are some major issues with your current development initiatives or strategy. Terrible F.
I updated the app. Now I can't even put in my email. I miss the old app.
Never able to access the app. I always got a message saying unable to communicate with server. Finally just decided to uninstall.
"What I'd really like to see is besides just the basic sleep, things like oxygen level pulse, etc. I'd like to be able to store what my oxygen saturation level is doing for my sleep physician to review."
The app is supposed to sync with Google fit and it doesn't. It shows 2000 steps when I've done 12000 etc. I have to keep manually entering my steps. It is frustrating. Signing out and back in does not help the issue and neither does refreshing the page.
Very glad they updated and fixed the bugs it had issues accepting information from fit bit but since the update seems to be doing great thanks for the patches and fixes üëç
Didn't try yet
Great
This is this most complicated app I have ever seen.
Latest update is a step backwards. 3 year user. Disappointed. More steps to get what I regularly use such as the challenge page. Less intuitive UX.
Just don't like it it puts my blood pressure through the roof
Great app for staying on track with health and medictions.
"Keeps forgetting or changing the password, requiring a reset."
Don't use
So far so good
Blank page
"Okay at best, but the step tracker is way off . I sync the app with Samsung Health, which correctly shows 200 steps so far, but Sharecare shows that plus 5500 steps that I haven't taken supposedly tracked by Sharecare itself. When I click the option to stop tracking steps and sleep, it deletes all information, even what it should be importing from Samsung. I can't get it to just remove the incorrect extra steps and there's no in-app place I can find to reach out to support - very frustrating."
Last update sucks. It's harder and more time consuming to enter data and it will not count steps.
A great health app.
"A lot of glitches. Does not allow certain features that are available in the website such as goal setting. Does not allow more than one glucose reading per day, only fasting. Scale does not sync reliably. Very limited."
"Ok, until it used 42 GB of my mobile data in 2 days!! The app was ok at first, it enabled me to get some credit back on my med. insurance cost by tracking my steps. I had been using the app for 5 mnths & then one morning I get a text notification that I had used 48 GB of data in half the months time. I spent 1 hr chatting with them online and they told me to contact my mobile provider to increase my data & they don't have a techsupport dept. *UNCHECK the background data usage in app settings!"
Used to work. Can't login anymore. I uninstalled and reinstalled. Still doesn't work.
I wish it interfaced with the My Air cpap app. Loving it
Won't allow me to login using my foldable device. Samsung galaxy fold3
"I cannot login with my Samsung Fold 3, I have uninstalled and reinstalled it multiple times with no success."
Great app
The stress and relationship tracking doesn't work. Otherwise it's fine. But it's pretty hard to meet my stress reduction challenge goals when it doesn't track that.
App wasn't working after updat - issue resolved and working well now
"used to work fine, but now completely broke, won't track steps at all or sync with Samsung health, will be impossible to complete any challenges. Don't refer me to customer support just fix it as I'm obviously not the only one having issues."
"Very buggy, won't save steps from Android Fit app."
Forced me to update and won't let me log in. Wants a verification code that expires in 10 minutes but takes 30 minutes to receive.
Had some helpful information
Would NOT allow me to register. Pretty useless if you can't create account
"I am not willing to be part of an unpaid troubleshooting team to get the syncing to work with a Pixel Phone. Customer support asked me to take screenshots everyday of my struggle to fix your app, which is not going to happen. inconsistent syncing with Samsung Health app. miscounts my steps every day. I emailed support and they dismissed my concern despite it still not automatically syncing. Iphone app works flawlessly, therefore I dont' think this app is very good, and why it deserves the 1-star rating. Updated October 2021."
I'm not sure if it is the app or the company that is so bad.
App not ready for prime time and it has been around for years. Every day you have go through series of questions outside the normal ones
Fast and easy
"With the recent update, the ability to connect to Samsung Health as a data source was removed and this is not mentioned in the release notes. This is not iseal when you were used to the automatic tracking for a health care incentive & this app stops transferring data without notice."
The app is to time consuming and not user friendly.
Love this app helps to keep track of health isssues and gives info to do better and stay healthy.
Great experiences
It keeps saying no internet connection and won't let me log in
Overall it's great. Frustrating at times as it doesn't sink with my Fitbit even after shutting it and turning it back on.
Great app it keeps you in the know with your health concerns and questions.
Johnny getting this out-of-the-way so far so good for some reason it said I already had an account and it recognized for some reason but when I went to empty thing it was saying wrong password or incorrect doesn't recognize my account another account with my information as in Maine or an email I would like to get in contact with you to find out history about that it's important because I've had people compromised and have prior emails
The app doesn't work with other apps to track steps.
"Tried both Google Fit and Samsung Health, it doesn't sync at all with step-count! What a terrible app!"
"UPDATE: This app is so annoying. Constantly force closes and force freezes smh. Can't even log my activity from yesterday, and I'd like to do it before I forget the dets, but haven't been able to open this app in over an hour now smh."
Always gives message about no internet connection when there is one. App needs work
"Since my last review back in 2018, this app has gotten even more sporadic and convoluted. It hardly if ever registers what I'm entering. The Auto trackers for steps and stress levels are not working. To think this is how I'm supposed to earn extra points so I can afford my medication. Very frustrating"
"User interface is extremely cluttery and obnoxious to use. 3rd party app support is terrible. Only supports syncing from 3 other apps, and these syncs are very glitchy. I sync it with my Google Fit account, but it only syncs one day at a time, and won't sync older date/times. Meaning I have to open the app everyday to track my stats. Additionally, it won't even let me manually update my previous day stats, so I am unable to receive my company's fitness incentives. Extremely frustrating."
Continues to refresh and log out.
App causing malware on my phone. Phone kept getting unwanted popup ads. Ran security scans and app was detected as a threat so I had to uninstall the app.
Good app for me to see all mines doctor appointment
Love it
No problem
"I have had this on my phone for well over a year. I walk 16000 to 18000 steps 4 days a week but this app doesn't track it to send it to my employer so I never get the 20.00 incentives. I should have made 280.00 by now. Every time I try to add manually, it kicks me out. I have tried to uninstall and reinstall with no luck. Absolutely worthless and a big disappointment. Thank goodness my GoogleFit tracks everything accurately, I just don't get incentive for it."
Works fine until it starts to track sleep. It's funny how my reviews keep disappearing. Please fix this so I can stop Uninstaller and reinstalling.
"I like the concept of the app, but the app itself is horrible. 1st, it is a lot of steps to answer some of the questions. For example, listing how many of each medication I take each day is cumbersome. Secondly, the app CRASHES multiple times a day. It is almost impossible to use the app because it crashes so often. Before the thought comes to mind, yes, my phone and the app are up to date."

The app has some glitches in it. When it says get started won't click and go to next screen also daily check ins won't work
The encouragement is very helpful
"I wish you could sync with garmin, not option for logging swimming vs steps, step manual entry isnt intuitive to add."
"I love how this app offers suggestions to help improve your all over well being. I saw the Lavendar night time \""hack\"" as lavendar is a natural calming aroma and I live all the info this app is full of!"
Step tracking had glitches but getting better
"Update from July 2, 2020, has wiped out all my data and then some. Over 9 GB. Horrible."
"It seems like a pretty good app, the tracking is not great. But it started using my microphone for no apparent reason..so I revoked its permissions. Mega sketch imo"
It was working good until yesterday cant connect to log into my rewards keeps saying communicate with server.
My experience with the program is outstanding I'm proud to be apart of this program AWESOME!!!
It's a very nice app. I really like the inspirational messages.
With the latest update both my husband's and my apps quit working correctly. It rarely opens and when it does it doesn't track steps and doesn't allow us to update our steps.
"Thus app has lost me money. I haven't been able to track anything consistently all year. It won't keep me logged in. I have given up on it. I use it to earn points so my insurance benefits will give me extra money toward my co-pays. I can't be the only one having this problem. It needs to be fixed or they need to just give us the points we would have gotten. I walk on average 10,000 steps a day at work according to my fitbit."
Sounds like a great app. When I open it however all it does ist flash and won't even let me log in.
Ok
I wish I would have started using this several years back! So many helpful features and options to engage and learn for starters like me!
I am trying to set a new password. I get an error message: 401 POST/api/change password. I have tried 3 different passwords and get the same error message.
Recent update made the app stop working on my android phone. App will not even open now..
1/27/22: Looks like issue fixed and app is working fine now. Thanks for the quick turnaround. 1/26/22: App is restarting and can't use. Uninstalled and reinstalled. Same issue
"App does not track with Samsung Health. Samsung says I made 14,110 steps yesterday. Sharecare says 2,800 and this is AFTER it claims it synced \""via Samsung Health\"". I am having to use this app for a challenge at work but this is going to cause me to loose unnecessarily. Ridiculous"
"The app is okay for what it is designed to do but navigation is not amazing and tracking things feels like it takes extra steps. I have a much easier time using the browser version on my computer. The thing I dislike the most about this app is the fact that when it tries tracking your sleep, which it never entered information for, it hogs your microphone in a way that prevents other apps or functions using it. I had to revoke microphone permissions to use my phonen like normal in the evenings."
Limited update sources for watches and sync with Google fit is hardly ever right.
"Does not accurately reflect steps, which is a problem when your employer gives monetary rewards for steps. Multiple email exchanges with the developers has not solved the problem. Very frustrating app to use. Not user-friendly. Virgin Pulse was much easier."
"So the password reset problem that started with an update several days ago wasfixed by today's update but now logging in process says I need to accept something that must be updated related to my employer and there is an error popup screen so app doesn't open whatever I'm supposed to read and accept. Since I still can't log in, my rating hasn't changed although I appreciated the response and fix. I have liked using the app before these issues...would like to be able to use it again."
Not easy to use. Too slow. Sync does not work well
App stalls and I have to close it and re-open to get in. Adding tracking information is cumbersome and slow.
Don't use the app a lot
It was working fine but lately I have had intermitant issues getting into the app and it is not tracking all my steps even though it is supposed to get it from my fitbit automatically. And now it won't allow me to edit the steps (less than a week ago).
"App was working fine and now all of a sudden over the past few days I'm getting a popup that wants to have access to my camera, calls, media files, location ect.. when I selected no and don't ask again it will no longer allow me to see anything else but that popup screen. Very disappointing!!"
"I'm enjoying the app overall. It doesn't keep up with the reward points like it should and I have missed out on incentives. Having MS, looking for relaxation techniques and such is a plus. It's hard to get a nurse call now. Waiting for May but I need help now."
Keeps me on track with my health with my lifestyle.
"I enjoy the articles shared, the insights given and the opportunity to monitor my \""green\"" days."
Love it.. easy to use
Helps remind me to stay focused on taking care of myself...mind...body...spirit.
"I can't get to the REDEEM page, anyone else experiencomg this?"
"8/23/22 Updated app again! This time, app won't even stay open. I open it, it closes within 5 seconds. Garbage. Updated app, cannot log in. Two days now. I get the verification code, but then I get an \""Unknown error\"" after the app says I need to provide more information. WTH?"
Sharecare is an excellent tool for staying healthy and on track.
Would not let me log in. Finally locked my account.
Lots of information. I linked my fitbit also
Not working for me.
Why oh why do you need so many permissions when i just need a covid shot appointment and floriduh uses you for this and this app doesn't have anything to do with vaccine appointments. Useless and stupid.
Garbage app. Fails to track steps and fails to reward money. This is nothing more than a way for the already terrible insurance companies to weasel out of paying out. Need a rating below 1 star.
app doesn't work consistently
My app was working fine and then suddenly... I have 3 Fs and 4 S for days of the week. It keeps losing the data I enter. I am extremely frustrated with this app.
Keeps crashing. When it worked out was awkward. Nutrition advice is 30 years out of date and sometimes counterproductive.
does not track heart rate: only steps. That means 0 points for weightlifting
There is no option to connect to Samsung Health.
Great app
"Dear sir or Madame; This is so good, I feel better then I have ever been before. Thank you share and care! Best regards Troy D.Te"
This application sucks. Cannot reset my password as the email that I get to reset brings me back to the share are app... If I copy and paste the URL into a web browser I receive an API error. Not worth my time.
A Must have
I love this app. It helps me to meet my goals set for a healthier lifestyle.
Doesn't work correctly most of the time
"SO disappointed. Just started using the app and didn't even have other issues as described by other users, but then Dr. Oz pops up in a video? No thank you. Actual scientists and physicians have challenged and rebuked most of the information this t.v. personality puts out and I don't do psuedo science or magic (placebo) wonder pills in my health plans."
Great
"I open the app, and it closes it out in 2 seconds. It will not stay open. And a year later still can't get this app to work and stay open. Today is June 1, 2023nand still the app won't stay open."
"I Love Share are,this app is wonderful."
Cannot sign in
Excellent app to use if you are looking to be more healthy.
I love this program/app. It gives you a constant reminder of how important you should be to yourself.
"Constantly tells me \""No Internet Connection\"" when trying to log in. I HAVE a connection! What is the issue here? On line Chat was useless üòí"
When my app updated.. now it won't work
"Since the update on 6/15, the app will not open. It says \""Your account requires an update. When I click Next, I get an Unknown server error. It worked perfectly always, although it could be arranged better, until now."
"Steps are not accurate and I disabled access to my calls because of the \""we're unable to manage stress of this call\"" notification. Is your programming team aware of these well documented issues. There's a ton of feedback comments on this"
Good
"Ever since I updated my phone your app keep saying that I have a notification. It tells me that it's tracking my steps and sleep, I say okay. It still shows a notification and again and again and again the same thing it's really annoying. Update: the issue seems to have resolved itself."
Worst app ever. Can't ever manage to login to account. Can't get help when needed. Only had a few weeks and has already had me reset password 4times and I still can't login. This is how they ROB FROM THE POOR. they are going to raise my health care premiums just because they can't get there app to work. This is the 3rd year have been forced to use this worthless app. A year later since I first wrote this and it isn't any better. Always something with this app.
I've used app for 2 years and thought it was overall great. This last update hasade it unusable. I log in and it requires an update. But has an internal server error.
Where is the list of free gyms for LAPRA?
"for many updates now it does not automatically track my steps consistently. it's synced with my Samsung health and even recognizes it is synced but will not track my steps. if I'm lucky it will track one day correctly then the next 5 or more days track \""no steps\"" out of the 16,000+ that I do a day or it will track and say I only took 32 steps the whole day. this app needs major improvements."
"I have not been able to log in. I tried resetting my password, but it keeps on giving me this 401 post error. Is there a way to fix it?"
Repeatedly crashes closed frequently.
Just doesn't work put password it says error then chaged password click the link in email after putting new password it says error again
Haven tryed this with DR.OZ Show Check it out on
Not working Just flashes. Uninstaller and reinstalled and still does it when you get to the pin page.
I was enjoying this app until recently. All of a sudden the app keeps closing. I log in and it won't stay open. Very frustrating!
I have so much trouble out of the app not calculating right or not showing me challenges very inconvenient
I love my share are app but now this is day 3 or 4 of me not being able to get in an complete my wellness for each day. Keeps saying I need to accept something or anything. So now I'm short completed days on my monthly challenge for June . And I have no clue how to fix it an it is up to date 5 he
It logs me out sometimes for days. Then keeps saying invalid login info. Now it won't let me redeem the points I have earned.
DATA COLLECTION SCAM
interesting topics!
It was an ok app but now I have to manually add everything. I don't know why Samsung was removed but now it requires a daily input by me. So it really doesn't do Anthony unless you use fitbit or some Google health thing.
Great people to help with the way you want to live a better Healthy life
it is such an easy app to use.
Very helpful
Keeps crashing. Daily check in doesn't work until a few days later.
